-0.2	Discussion was had with Bryson during the fortnightly meeting in regards to the hydraulic oil usage and cleanliness project. Clear instruction was given to Bryson in regards to the expect outcome of the project 2 weeks ago. However, according to the comments provided by Bryson in the meeting and the project database, it indicated that Bryson had not done the due deligence in regards to deliver the expect deliverable agreed 2 weeks ago, instead, only a brief investigation was carried out. The explaination from Bryson was that he had issues in acquiring the data for the project. However, I made it clear to him that my expectation was he should have let me know once he encountered the problem that requires my help to move forward but not wait until the fortnightly meeting and delay the project delivery. Bryson accepted this comment and agreed to meet my expectation.
0	Spoke with Steve and Ben in regards to the requirements for entering defects in Pulse. Told Steve and Ben that we need to put in the hours for any defects that are entered and we need to allocate labour to the hours for the defect. I told them that this was not a major thing but that we all just need to improve, also spoke about the fact that i had misled the crew and told them that it was ok to put the hours and labour required in the text of the defect. However, after discussions with Craig Bermingham it makes life quicker and easier for the planning department if we allocate labour and hours to the defect.
-0.2	Ben has had more than 10 days personal leave in the last 12 months hence the discussion.
-0.4	Tyler has been failing to meet some of the deadlines that I have been setting via email communication.  I have also noticed that emails that I send him are often not read or are read far too late for them to be effective.
-0.3	Bruce Connelly and Luke Holz had a discussion with Rob regarding the work that he has been carrying out without direct reference to the supervisors. Rob Was advised that he must follow the work management process and that he is not to go organising woirk of his own accord. This was discussed in length with Rob who showed resistance to the process and after long explanation was told thats how the process would work. Rob aslo expressed that he did not want to be cleaning the workshop anymore and that hewanted to do other work. Rob was advised that he would have to do the duties that he was employed to do and that  would work with him to do other duties that he was suited too. Rob was not happy with this and advised that he would quit if he was asked to clean. I had to explain to him that he had toi do his role  and could not pick and chose what he wanted to do. Further to this we discussed the good work that he had also done and was a vlued member of the team
-0.3	"I had a discussion with Pat Morton around Safety and what I require from him going forward. After the recent discussions that Bengalla has had with regards to Leadership Intervention and Safety, I wasn’t happy with his attitude as to what is required.
Pat is a good technician, does the relevant paperwork that is needed and his tradesman skills are what is required to have the CHPP availability and production at a maximum.
I believe Pat does do good work and is mostly conscientious, show’s initiative but sometimes doesn’t show the respect to his leader’s that he would like to be shown to himself.
Pat’s general mannerism can be off putting and sometimes very frustrating, he sometimes needs to think before he speaks.
Pat let’s himself down sometimes by his lack of focus and commitment to the task.

I have made it clear to Pat that I won’t tolerate unsafe behaviour and that he needs to improve his mannerism.

-0.3	A team meeting was scheduled by the superintendent and meeting invitation was sent at 3:30 pm during the normal work hours. Tom was observed to start work at around 9:00 am for the day and left the office at around 3:30 pm without accepting the meeting invitation.
-0.4	I told Tom that i had noticed he hadn't completed any Safety Interaction since July and i asked why?  Tom explained that he was very passionate about safety interaction, though he has now lost that passion as he is continually seeing procedural breaches in regards to PPE and sees that the technicians are not being pulled up about it.  He said that he is the only one that is having difficult conversation with these people.
-0.3	"Bernie continues to have conversations with office staff at the CHPP , he has been told to limit these conversations. i have requested Bernie to only have required conversations when required to complete his days work.

I have had follow up conversations with staff and they on most occassions did not invite Bernie in to a conversation."
-0.5	"Steve Reddie raised concerns in regards to the IntelliHR training that is occurring.  This prompted Ken to raise his concerns along the same lines that the system has not been communicated correctly and that a catch up with some one is not training.  I explained that the trainer was on site for a number of catch up times where Ken and others can go along and learn how to use IntelliHR.  Can said that he would not be attending and that the company needs to provide formal training.  I again explained that the trainer was in place for one on one catch ups if people felt they needed it.  Ken continued in front of the team to say that he wouldn't be going and that he wont be suing the system.  I told Ken that we can discuss after the meeting, Ken continued to say that i can catch up with him, though he would not be going to the trainer.  I reiterated to Ken that i would talk to him after the meeting.3

0.1	Spoke with Cliff and Kev in the control Room in regards to the requirements for entering defects in Pulse. Told Cliff and Kev that we need to put in the hours for any defects that are entered and we need to allocate labour to the hours for the defect.

0	I noticed that Steve was not logging on to Damstra.  I asked Steve as to why he wasnt logging on to Damstra and he said that he was really just waiting to see if it was going to be used and acted upon (testing the system).
-0.3	It was observed that Bryson had spent excessive time (from 10:00 am to 11:30 am) on dealing with personal issue online. Clear expectation had been reinforced with him on the scene that he should not spend excessive time on personal issue during work hours. If the issue is urgent the business would be flexible and support him for taking time off to deal with it.
0	"Adam had previously replied via email to a Red Banner communications from Cam with a query regarding whether a situation in the workshop should also be the subject of a Red Banner communication. This was discussed between Cam, Scott, Adam and Nick and concluded that it was not an incident report or Red Banner. It is not clear whether this feedback was given to Adam.

On 25/7/17 at 2pm, Rod Hamson approached myself asking what was happening with the scissor lift exit issue detailed above, as Adam had contacted him to say that he still had concerns. Adam had sent an email at about 1:30pm continuing the conversation with Cam and asking for an update regarding the issue. I spoke with Rod, Tom Griffiths and Nick to get an update and then caught up with Adam in the workshop. Conversation summary:

- I gave Adam an update on the status of the concern he had raised and continued in his email to Cam today
- We discussed the issue as being something that no-one at Bengalla was aware of and an opportunity to improve our systems with respect to the Australian Standards non-compliance
- I informed Adam that it had been discussed at CEO/Mgr/Supt/Supv level that the event was not an incident report or a Red Banner. Adam said he didn't really understand why minor damage reports were entered but 'safety issues' were not. I replied that the issue had been assessed as a compliance risk and not an actual safety issue.
- I asked Adam to raise issues like these with his appropriate chain of leadership first in future rather than going to the CEO. He replied that he was continuing the email chain previously. I responded that he would get a more effective answer by giving his direct supervisor, superintendent etc the opportunity to respond first before escalating if he wasn't happy with the response.
- I informed Adam that he could come under scrutiny for his behaviours in future if he raised issues at a higher level before his immediate supervisors. He replied that he didn't care if he 'got a letter' for doing that if it meant he got a response. Adam seemed to loosely agree (nodded, 'yeah OK') that he should give his supervisors opportunity to respond before going higher in future.
- I said that a stronger feedback loop could fix some of the issues if he felt like his concerns weren't getting assessed or actioned where required.

A number of other topics were covered in the conversation along the same lines.
"
-0.3	It was observed by both team leader and superintendent that Tom had been attend work late (around 8:45 am) and leave early (around 3:45 pm) on a number of occasions in the last few weeks.
0	"Feedback session with Cliff

Positives:
* Work ethic and sticking to a task
* Knowledge in the plant and willingness to assist
* Questioning of issues - Cliff is not afraid to bring up issues and hold me to account. Told Cliff this is good as it means he cares about the site and wants things to be right.

Areas to work on:
* Wearing of safety glasses - one discussion with Cliff prior to this and spoke about the need to improve
* Live test permits in the BPF area. We use them but we need to be better.

Feedback for me:
* Cliff questioned if there was any issues with me asking Bengalla employees to do work as he said it seems I revert to asking Kaine McDonald a bit. I said that this was not intended if it came across this way and that i have no issues. Spoke a for a bit about this but this was the general conversation."
-0.5	"This discussion was about Pat not fulfilling his role as a technician.
The tailings section of the plant was the most challenging of the areas tonight due to the coal type been presented by the mine. Pat showed a lack of interest and commitment to keep the plant running to meet the required targets as this coal is to be loaded onto a train the next day.
Pat took offence for being told to do his job.

0.3	Greg assisted the business by filling in as a step up supervisor on Friday 15th September 2017 at short notice. This is an example of Greg willing to take on responsibilities outside of  his normal duties to assist the business.
-0.3	Discussed Toms communication techniques and how he seemed aggrevated during the leadership alignment session on 04/07/17.  Tom was abrupt at some stages and shut down Leo Liang in an inappropraite fashion.
0.3	"Greg had been assigned a service provider who had not completed the work that he had been assigned. The task involved gaining access to RC301 and applying rope lube to the harrow winch ropes. While this is an expectation for our employees, Greg took the time to walk the service provider through the task to be completed pointing out the relevant points prior to leaving him to complete the work.

This diary note was from my own observations and speaking with the service provider during a safety interaction."
-0.2	"I noticed that Tom was not logging on to Damstra.  Had a discussion with tom and asked why he wasn't.  He had two concerns; he was currently starting a little later due to home issues and he didn't like the security around the personal information.  We discussed the security and he was fine with that.  I also told him that the Damstra system will not take away any work flexibility and if he has things going on at home then he can just let us know that he is going to be late.

Tom agreed that he would start using the system."
-0.3	"qestioned Lloyds as to why he was sitting in a vehicle in the stores yard [backed up at the end of the row] at 5.15pm. he stated he was checking stock levels for stuart duff from schenck and he called him back to confirm. Lloyd was getting upset because i was questioning him and he said you are starting again [ refering to a conversation we had with Russell Hartin approx 5 weeks ago] he stated i could call Stuart duff and check. when i called stuart he said he called lloyd at approx 3 pm and asked about stock levels and lloyd had not called back that afternoon.
i told lloyd that the conversation was over and that i would be making a diary note for reference."
-0.3	Observation in the last few weeks suggested that Bryson was distracted at work and spending excessive work hours on dealing with personal issues with excessive break.
