-0.6	As we have had many new staff changes in the last 6 months i'm finding that people are not being properly trained and that's causing a knock on effect. To further this we have complacent staff and I feel like i have been doing my workload and those of other peoples/departments. I feel that if I don't then nothing would get done.
0.35	Much happier than I used to be.
0.65	Enjoying the workplace and the work
-0.05	My work is satisfying as I can measure personal contribution/s and outcomes, however when other team members do not perform to known required standards I feel greatly let down.
0.8	I am very happy in my role, it gives me freedom of being in control of my movements to an extent and doesn't hold me down in an office environment.
0.9	I love my job
0.15	Satisfied
0.75	overall very happy with my current roll
0.05	I'm pretty satisfied with my job, sometimes frustrating when there's not not much time allocated to get your attendance registers ready for the next week, but that's just apart of the job I guess... learning to adapt.
0.45	I still enjoy my role and love some of the challenges that I face everyday.  I work with a good group of people who are trying to do there best.  I am developing all the time and look forward to increasing my abilities to serve our client better.  The only frustration is at time s Ifeel a bit overloaded and can not complete the task that are either set by me or set by others.
0	I am satisfied with my role and I am enjoying my tasks, very much, however I have been with F5M just over 2 years, and it never mentioned any increase in my current pay.
-0.85	understaffed, equipment not working the way it should, I feel overworked and underpaid, have to put in extra hours to try and keep up, still not good enough
-0.35	First week was hectic as expected, computer issues caused frustration.
-0.4	During busy periods, insufficient time is allocated to the administrative function associated with on site tasks. Greg Peever is attempting to address this issue. There are ongoing issues with insufficient or incorrect information being provided on consultants schedules. Again, I believe Greg is trying hard to rectify these issues.
-0.25	I feel that my role is impacted not only by myself, but from all of our team, both locally in NSW and across the country. I feel like my direct supervisor is responsible for too much within our office and should have some managerial support. In essence I feel like he is a talented person in our field, however is wasted by being responsible for  low level responsibilities that take up too much time. I also am not a fan of some of the new training material we have been provided. I feel that it shows that there is a disconnect with what we are as a company and what our clients needs are.
0.95	I gain great satisfaction from all facets of my role.
-0.15	Satified with the role the excessive hours to complete necessary work is tiring at times
0.55	I'm looking forward to being able to deliver some new presentations.  A fresh look to present to our clients.
0.15	I'm quite satisfied, I just wish we had more time allocated to finish jobs off. We often have to work past 1700 particularly on reginal trips
0.8	A Great office and atmosphere
0.5	Much better now with Webconnect performally admirably.  Scheduling are taking into account the time required and importance of adequate time to complete the training reports agains the KPI's.  Currently the Queesnalnd buisness unit has a large number of hot fire training sessions.  We have a piece of equipment which would be great to have back in service to use for this service delivery.
0	Nothing new to report
-0.15	My satisfaction in my role is only curbed by the frustration in the constant changes to procedures & lack of training for all departments involved in those changes.
-0.1	I continue to love my job and work beside my colleauges in a job I am passionate about. However, I continue to become increasingly frustrated by the company itsself.
-0.15	I enjoy my role as Operations Manager - however I feel that I am been pulled in too directions. I have a large amount of direct reports and I feel sometimes I am not spending enough time with the employees to assist with their development.
0	n/a
-0.5	Spread over to many roles. Prof Dev not allocated outside F5M
-0.4	To Many changes to schedules, with no or short notice which makes it difficult to appear prepared and professional.
-0.35	The I.T. Is quite frustrating at times
-0.4	computer hardware has issues
0.15	Generally happy with my role.Once the new procedures and equipment are implemented i believe this will improve on the general attitude from all consultants.
-0.7	I feel I'm not being recognised for a lot of the work I do.  I don't think my title actually reflects  with what work I actually take on.  Personally I don't understand what  separates me from being a supervisor and a manager.
0.35	I feel that I makea valuable contributions to the tune
0.85	I am finding work intellectually challenging and invigorating.  Further, I love the new premises.
-0.5	I find it takes too long to get simple things happening and the need to rely on others with differing sets of priorities
0.15	Enjoy the role and improvements in Key Accounts. Back end procedures and workflow can be improved to free me up.
-0.2	Need more challenges
-0.8	Frustration is a part of our every day tasks . Inadequate technology challenges our time management on a daily basis.
-0.75	The role is rarely recognised for their hard work but quick to blame when there is an error.
-0.6	To many things on the plate. My specialist skills not being used to advance the company
-0.2	More Training in management.  As previously mentioned.
-0.1	As previously stated I have reached a plateau for my position given my age and cessation of my tenure within the next couple of years I still work to read journals and other works that keep me abreast of current fire engineering and statutory requirements.  I could not commit to any post graduate study and believe I am maintaining consistency in my skill-sets with my current regime.
0	nothing at this moment in time
0	None, too ealy to assess.
-0.1	Some retraining in certain ares such as design work
0.65	I am provided with full support within this BU, as well as from our Corporate office.   
-0.05	CMARS Super-user training would help with creating lists for client / finance reporting.
-0.75	Some things have been mentioned before and nothing has been done about it or we have received no feedback on what the outcome was. This is frustrating to say the least.  Firstly, the sales dept. require training in setting up jobs to make it easier for consultants to complete. I have been to several sites where the product has been inputted wrong and its the consultant that ends up wearing the displeasure of the client. For example... I had a design job recently where there were 3 diagrams requested by sales and when I attended site I found that 9 were needed...There are many more examples like this. Our work stations are too small and have the incorrect (or No) equipment on them. We are expected to make do with what we have. Chairs that work, Monitors and stands, and correctly ergonomically set up work stations would be very beneficial.  Thank you.  
0.3	As stated before I am very keen in gaining further skills in the technical areas so as to assist Keran when needed and also my own consulting team,  I am also very keen in becoming more involved in the national development area to standardise our products a cross the country.  So there fore any Course that would assist in these areas would I feel be beneficial.
0.1	 i would like a bit more help with the Query Builder in Cmars.  I did achieve a few step, but I would benefit more guiding. 
-0.1	No training needed, we just need to work on process
0	having the tools to deliver some of the new products
0.1	Up Skilling, Meeting more Clients and going out with Consultants and going out with the Sales team
-0.15	When things settle down in the office and Nick is not so under the pump I would still like to Lear how to put quotes in
0.8	I feel very supported already.
-0.5	If the software we use would not have so many glitches. The client would be happier and things would run more smoothly and efficiently.
-0.45	- Although I am the Product Manager, since I started in the role, I have never actually received any product training. I essentially trained myself, with some input from key team-members.  This has however limited my understanding of the CMARS system and the system logic to the product library (I can see that there are multiple flaws that need cleaning up). I was promised CMARS training last May, but it never happened. I understand that this was due to a trainer resourcing issue, but if I received the training, the company's resources in this area would increase. I'd also have the ability to flag and fix issues.  - The future F5M's marketing is in the digital space.  I have been working in the field for years, but would be interested in receiving further training in the use of back-end web tools. There is plenty of opportunity for the company to benefit from enhanced in-house SEO and SEM. I would like the time and resources to learn more and offer additional benefit to the company. 
-0.35	I feel we need to overhaul our aged care training. I feel I can contribute to this overhaul. I am a full time professional Fire Fighter aswell as trainer with First 5 Minutes and my training with FRNSW has given me specific knowledge on this topic in particular. I have discussed this at the office but we have yet to be able to expand on it. I feel the business needs to look at the way we do business internally. As a part timer, granted I am not in the office as much as others, but I am puzzled at the direction and leadership within the business. Before becoming a firefighter I was a Store Manager with a supermarket chain, involved in all levels of business management from finances to HR to people to Customer Service. Having this experience has given me perspective on such topics of leadership, management and direction. I see  a great asset to First 5 Minutes in our Regional Manager Jason Taylor, but he has been required to wear too many hats. He has great vision and great management skills, but needs a better support structure so he can manage. I always feeel inspired when I am in the office going through anything with him. He is under utilised by having to perform tasks that he should have staff to perform for him. I think this has a trickle down affect on the rest of the business, because such a great management asset is being used incorrectly. I have never understood how staff can work in a state office and answer to someone other then the regional manager of that office. We have lost staff and not filled the holes. Without singling anyone out in particular, I cant believe we still run with the way we conduct our sales. The feedback from the front line combined with my personal experience over the years- our sales team needs a major overhaul. It leaves a lot to be desired. We need to jump on Active Shooter, develop something and get training packages out there, because its something industry is screaming for and no one is really delivering at a high level. Its money for jam, and we are letting it go. I know this has probably come off as a bit of a rant, but I only put this down because I care about the business. This is a "secondary employment" When you look at contracted hours, but I honestly put more time and effort into First 5 Minutes then I do FRNSW. When I finish my shift with FRNSW that's it, I am done. With F5 I am constantly staying up late, finishing reports, replying to emails, following up client requests. And that's as a part timer. I have every intention to stay with F5 for many, many years to come and I value my job. This is why I want our company to be the best. To be the market leader, to grow and evolve. My biggest wish for First 5 Minutes is to be a company that cares about the people we speak to and train. I don't want to ever feel like we go through the motions to tick a box. I want to make a difference, and I hope we as a company will do. I am willing to help anyway I can to help make our business the best it can be. Just let me know how I can.
-0.15	A structure approach to sales leads that shows whether it has been followed up. A greater ability to give constructive criticism at a higher level on our bread and butter items, such as new Power Point Presentations, or Tenant Briefing documentation
-0.05	Would like to have some Audit training to help me understand the consultants position on this and what they face onsite.
-0.1	As the OHS reviews are about to be launched, I would appreciate some training prior to delivering the product.
0.2	Some assistance with the use of  ms word which could make what send to the client quicker/better ie mail merge and or the like.  Thanks for the opportunity to provide this feedback.
-0.5	Could you please re-visit the allocated time for design work.  As an example I have been given 1 hour to mark up 2 floor plates, 14 diagrams on a site that has no floorplates supplied.
0.3	I believe that First 5 Minutes support in my current roll by giving the tools that will help me be more efficient. Below are a few suggestions; •        Enabling us (the trainers) to utilise the cloud to upload diagrams and attendance registers.  •        Investing in technology that will allow us to utilise the cloud for all of our requirements.  Going forward I would like to develop professionally within the company and take on  greater responsibility. I feel that I have a lot to offer the team and the business and would like to very much be a part of the success in the future.  
0	At the moment the training as a consultant is going well but one area that may need to be looked at is the consistency of what the consultants are delivering to our clients across the board and the resources (power point presentations) need to be looked out.
0.05	Any chance to get more training regarding this role would always be appreciated.  Also, an update to the system that we currently use would also be very helpful.
-0.05	Two way communication meetings from senior managers in Melbourne/Brisbane regarding several chosen specialised topics.
-0.05	I feel that I am lacking in the area of threat management.
-0.05	I would like to know more in regard to Sky 5 enabling me to lever off their products.
-0.2	I would like to see the hierarchy change for NSW BU, I feel that I am managing from the Operations side of the business, but feel that there is a need for a highly skill Business development manager or Senior Manager to assist with Clients and Finance, I currently do not have that experience as yet, however I am learning every day.  
-0.25	We need greater support from the business in driving revenue recognition each month. We still believe that there isn't enough accountability or responsiveness from the business on this aspect, despite it affecting their financial performance or incentives.
-0.1	As previously  stated I would like further training or a Qualification in Auditing, as I believe this would increase my knowledge and professionalism in the Fire Safety Audits and Audits that we do. Also improving my Qualifications from a Cert IV to a Diploma would also benefit not only me but the Company as well.
-0.15	FIP, ASD and ROMTECK training.  Accredited warden training  A system/plan for design jobs rather than just sending  emails
-0.4	Hostage/Lock down/Active Shooter!!!!! I've had no training or experience in this subject at all. I'm basically just reading out the presentation.
-0.45	It is starting to become apparent that time is not allocated for larger jobs unless we ask for it. If we get larger establishments, an Audit or FSA then I thing we should get time allocated on our schedules to complete the paperwork for those. I have had a few last minute jobs added to my schedule lately when I had already allocated that time in my head to catch up on paperwork. Therefore that paperwork didn't get done so it adds up causing stress and irritability.  I think once or twice a week if we can have a couple of hrs allocated on our schedules to do paperwork, I for one, would be a lot happier. 
0.05	I would like to improve on my report writing skills and knowledge as well as my knowledge of word, Excel and Blue beam. If I can improve on these things then my productivity would improve. I'd like F5M to look at any one of these courses to help me improve. I am also willing to look at paying for a course that would help me improve in my role.
0.1	I am happy with support so far, i would like maybe some more communication around general F5M activities that are cultivated nationally.
-0.55	IT  - my computer crashes and freezes almost daily,  All these issues have been addressed by SA Management and IT have been advised with tickets logged and phone conversations had. Sometimes my computer is that slow that in the middle of rescheduling training in CMARS with the client on the phone, i need to make up a story (usually I am just experiencing some technical difficulties right now etc)  and call them back. This happens almost daily. I wish i had the right tools to be able to excel in my job. Career pathways - I have an interest in HR and systems, this is my back ground. I have a Dual Diploma in Management (Business and Front line) I would love to do some Professional Development within the area of HR / Systems if it was offered.
0	1) Letting me develop packages which would put F5M in the forefront of high level security and counter terrorism training. This would be derived mainly from 30 years life experience in this area  2) Be involved in marketing this material  3) Be involved in developing other material such as workplace violence awareness, security awareness and armed hold up training.   4) Be given credit what packages which I develop. Not having someone change a couple of slides and put their name on the package as the author  5) Have the ability to speak directly to senior managament (CEO and CFO) about my ideas and thoughts to review existing specialised training material . I do not wish to involve my State Manager because , mainly if its it a contructive comment or when I observe contentsof packages which arent factual, dangerous or increased the liability for F5M. I do not wish my comments to effect the State Managers position within the company nor would I want him to defend my comments. I wish to stand on my own feet when offering comments. Basically I do not wish Jason to convey my comments on my behalf and receive the negative feedback from other managers.  I wish to do it from my own accord and debate the points accordingly with the respective managers.  6) Also be great if the CFO and CEO recognise the extent of my life skills, experience and training and how it would benefit F5M, especially in todays environment of contastant terrorist incidents.   7) Could start a High level Security and Counter Terrorism response Training and Consulting -  Business Unit within F5M. There is no requirement for any Security Master Licence. Its purely providing high level expertise to clients nationally. THis can be tied into the existing Emergency Management training.
-0.1	As discussed with Anthony it would be helpful to be able to work from home. I've been doing a lot of additional hours recently and it would be nice to be able to work from the comfort of home where I can still contribute and have time with my family. It also means that i'm not alone at work and coming home after dark particularly on days where i take public transport.   I'd like to go on site for complex establishments.This would make understanding and quoting the more difficult proposals easier and it gives me a better perspective.  NB: this is already being actioned after discussions with Anthony. (thank you) Just waiting for some complex establishments to arise. 
-0.55	Being swamped with work, being unable to complete reports in an efficient manner due to the constant problems with Web Connect.
-0.3	Having to re-explain the design process to consultants
0.15	I can not say that I have any areas that I do not enjoy I can only comment that there needs to quicker flow of communications.  I thoroughly enjoy the challenges that this job has and yes at times it does or can become overloaded.
-0.35	In my role preparing reports towards the month end, I do not enjoy the delay in submission of reports from other staff. I try to send early follow-ups and reminders to those concerned if they are not giving us the required information on time.  When there is delay, we have to work double-time to compensate such delay and we can still provide the collated reports before the deadline.
-0.3	When there are inconsistencies with the quantities and confusion about the requirements for a job.  In some cases, there are jobs that have missing information or unclear instructions but needs to be done ASAP - it's quite impossible to finish creating something straightaway if it's still missing some of the parts.  
0.6	no comment  I am happy
-0.55	The constant issues we have with design work that absorb so much time that could otherwise could be spent promoting and growing the company gets to me.  The repetition,  time waste and negativity caused by design work as well as the continual battle to have staff focus and work together in a timely manner to overcome the roadblocks in our existing processes.  It is hoped the new design process will greatly assist in overcome many of the identified black spots  Whilst I prefer to take a big picture view of the world a lot of our work involves minutia, it's what we have to do to get through the day, unfortunately our clients are requiring more and more TLC, constantly requesting additional reporting and services which they don't like having to pay for
-0.5	- Sometimes it feels as if all we do is "trace" all day.  As a creative person can be a little disenchanting. But this job is what it is.   - I feel like I'm not learning any new skills. I'm worried in this role that 3 years could pass and I could have spent the whole time tracing, doing EMM's and I'm no better enriched with new skills, more responsibilities and the same pay.   
-0.4	The recent knock we have taken with WebConnet has set the business back considerably.  Although there is work being done to rectify the situation, there has been significant damage done to our reputation and dealing with this on a day to day basis has been very difficult from the coalface.  The struggle to implement a state based scheduling capability.  This has been very challenging and frustrating; however I have noticed a slight improvement over the past few days with what we have implemented - although this has taken considerable time to bed down!!  I am confident though that there will be significant improvement in the weeks to come.
-0.55	*Not being renumerated for long periods of time – my wage is close to the award wage & I feel my efforts are worth much more  than that as I always work hard,  put in my best effort & the quality of work I produce is of high quality I believe.  *Communication between businesses departments are sometimes lacking 
-0.4	Poor communication within the company is my biggest gripe and source of frustration, also a lack of understanding of what I actually contribute to the company.  being the sole responsible person for all SPOT enquiries.
-0.25	I have not enjoyed dealing with rude property managers, however, I am able to deal with these situations in a professional manner. More often than not, I can turn this into a positive outcome which is then beneficial for future correspondence with the client.  I have also found challenges with certain processes (e.g Webconnect) but I know it is only a matter of time before these issues are rectified. It is not an issue that troubles me too much nor my working ability.
-0.25	Rushing to get from one job to another in  a short amount of time or missing lunch due to jobs being to close together that we miss out
-0.45	I am not fond of the paperwork aspects of the role and a few other manual data entry processes. There have been promises that these are to be streamlined or revised to make things more efficient but updates on the progress of this are few and far between.
-0.4	I do not enjoy being in the office sitting in front of the computer all day.
-0.45	per 3, there was some difficulty/resistance with some staff at the beginning of my tenure.
-0.1	At the present moment, conducting complex Establishment diagrams. However it is a challenge and I have improved my knowledge in this field by consulting my manager and other consultants
-0.15	Whilst I believe that I am quite good at it, minute taking at the board level is a distraction for me being able to be more active at the board table. I also believe that travel/accommodation co-ordination and board pack compilation for the board would be better performed by an EA role which will undergo recruitment shortly.
-0.65	We have had many problems with our IT systems over the last few months.  It is very frustrating not to be able to use the tools you need to do the job.  It is also frustrating to spend a lot of time on a simple task (i.e. reschedule a training event) because we are under-resourced, not enough trainers to put events against, not enough co-ordinators. I do not enjoy preparing our regional trips, they are usually hard to confirm and do not seem worthwhile - we are often talking about offering on-line training to some of those clients, but talking about it is all we do. I do not like that we do not have enough direct contact with our clients, we are not talking to them enough - all templates, all emails.  Not enough time to deliver excellent customer service.
-0.45	Not having sufficient time to complete administrative work associated with jobs. Feeling the need to complete tasks in my own time to stay on top of the workload. No time allocated to prepare for the upcoming week.
-0.2	There hasn't been too many negatives to my role most of the negatives are beyond my control -webconnect for example not functioning correctly- this does make my role harder especially the negative feedback from our clients and the response they get from us is not easing the situation.
-0.25	The feedback from our clients in regards to Web connect which is still a sore point due to the inaccessibility of files that our clients require. The other frustrating part of my role is the delay in the new surface pro laptops as this will be a welcome addition to the consultants work equipment. 
-0.7	I don’t enjoy having to work around the issues that I have experienced. Constantly I am experiencing issues with  •        the laptop and the software installed. The support that I get from the IT department is great but having to leave the laptop at home so they can log in and fix the problem  and then me having to use my personal computer to conduct training secessions is unacceptable.  •        Receiving planners late on a Friday afternoon. – this in my view is unacceptable. Receiving my planner at 5pm on a Friday leaves me no time to prepare for the following weeks work. It also plays havoc with family planning,  •        Having wrong information on planner – constantly I am receiving my planner with wrong start times for events. This not only reflects badly on me as a trainer (turning up late to a client) but also on first 5 minutes. How long can we blame daylight savings. •        Scheduling – it frustrates me as to why 1 trainer goes to site and then another trainer is there in a few weeks, or might be in the area the next day, Why can’t we group the different regions to this from happening.  •        Accommodation – some of the places that I stay at are totally unacceptable. We are spending at times 5 days away from our homes and families, the places that we stay become our offices and homes and this needs to be reflected in the standard of the accommodation  •        Accessibility to the internet while on the road. – I know that we receive a data allowance and this might have on par 10years ago but now days the allowance is only covering me looking at my emails it does not allow me to connect to cmars sync and upload information or log into web connect to complete a report. For me this is a tool that I need to complete my role and therefore I need to be compensated.  
-0.8	Sales - When I was employed I made it quite clear (in writing) that if a sales manager was the role they were trying to fill I was not their man. I was assured that this was not the case and that the only sales component of the role would be supporting the sales rep with client meetings etc. for submitted proposal reviews. This of course turned out to be a fairy tale! Within a few months the new sales resource at the time had left after proving to be unsuitable for the role and I became the primary source of sales generation for the business by default. For the next 18 months this formed the main thrust of my daily work and has not really changed to much extent to the present day. Through a series of events that have influenced this output I remain in the position of either selling myself or up skilling others to sell without any real background in selling or desire to do so. After spending a year quietly teaching one staff member the processes and skills to be a good inbound sales resource to take some of the load away that member accepted a new role as a sales resource for another state! (and on a personal level as a good manager/employer I am happy for her that she has been able to grow and improve her lot. I believe that we have a responsibility to ensure to the best of our ability that our people do grow and build new skills etc. while we are their managers.) Still - at the end of the day I can sell, I do sell, but I hate it. Some stress is good stress - it drives us to perform and to step out of our comfort zones but as time has gone by I have not enjoyed the continual pressure to meet and exceed budgetary targets without the resources to have much chance to actually do so. I have not enjoyed some aspects of what I have perceived as failings by my peers that have affected my ability to perform and produce outputs to my full potential. For instance - to be giving the job my best shot to not only reverse the inherited trend and reputation locally but to improve the processes and products we utilised whilst changing the poisonous local culture that existed only to have a temp. CEO march into the mix and immediately apply a 'divide and conquer' confrontational style of management that may have been appropriate in the 1980's supported by unreasonable and often completely unachievable demands and outcomes and a 'school bully' type of interaction with his staff took me to a stage of seriously considering leaving the company. The damage done during this mans' short tenure took much longer to mend after he'd left.
-0.4	Its not that I don't enjoy anything, it's more frustrating.I find when I want too do some type of reporting and planning productivity I don't have the tools to do this.  
0.1	Honestly there is not much I don't enjoy about my role, sometimes the data entry in CMARS can be a little tedious but that's just generalizing.
-0.25	I don't enjoy it very much when I have a couple of days of back to back training only i.e. no evacuation, FSA, or audits, just training sessions
-0.55	Would prefer to not say.
-0.2	The data management can be significantly time-consuming. This is due to having unreliable, inaccurate, or incomplete data in CMARS, etc.  However, this will improve over time, as former issues/flaws in the collection of data are being addressed (e.g. market segmentation). 
-0.45	I have not enjoyed that I am unable to complete my reports through web connect. I am measured on the time taken for me to complete my report. I don’t feel that I am supported
-0.35	Even though I am a morning person, the early starts. For example a 0700 start at Noosa GUG, that means getting up at 0430 to shower, have breakfast, etc. and on the road so you get there early to set up.   Being the 'face' of the Company we do occasionally are the brunt of frustrations of Clients, but you do what you can to put them at ease.  On the above, I would say that it's more of part of the job of a trainer than a part that I have not enjoyed. If there is anything that I don't like is when I am away and I get a hire Car that I need to get into with a shoehorn.
-0.4	Managing a somewhat challenging Team in the Perth Office.  It seems that each staff member has a relative weakness in what they bring to the business and working on improving these areas can be exhausting and frustrating.    I also struggle with the rudeness of some of the PM's we gave to work with.
-0.45	At times having to deal with confrontation and frustrations within the unit due to areas out of my control.  However saying this it is always a good challenge to be able to beat this with a positive approach.  I dont htink I would ever enjoy dealing in this area but with further help and mentoring I would be able to mange better  
-0.45	As a team member I desperately need to trust my colleagues to 'do their part' to the best of their ability but unfortunately I've felt let down on numerous occassions so I must try and do everything (where I can) so that the end product is timely, correct, and reflects F5M in the best light possible.
-0.3	There seems to be a lot of inconsistency in the approaches of different consultants and the ways the procedure are applied to these diversions. I find this really tricky because it is such a formulated process, and it needs to be in order to be efficient & timely. It makes decision making & application of information hard because different scenarios seem to be treated with a different 'set of rules'.
-0.25	The only area that is a little frustrating is when a Consultant has been given feedback on areas they need to improve with their auditing and several audits later the same issues are occurring.
-0.45	DIFFICULTIES IN ACCESSING CLEAR ACCURATE INFORMATION WHILE PREPARING TO CONDUCT ESTABLISHMENTS  
-0.15	Receiving complaints from clients & trainers about webconnect that I can not fix and can not give an explanation about
-0.3	I don't enjoy evacuating small shopping centres where their is not centre management on site at inappropriate times for example 4 pm weekdays.
-0.55	Having to discuss with the client that our unique ability to maintain their compliance via a website based solution continues to fail, and the need to continually apologise for this failure to remedy their growing frustrations  these frustrations are causing morale issues across the team
0.45	I enjoy doing the bank reconciliations and I do it almost daily so that no data will build up towards month end.  I also enjoy doing the month end reporting. It gives me satisfaction when all of these are presented accurately, on time and without delay.
0.15	Learning details of different kinds of sites and collaborating with consultants and other team members to find solutions to issues.
0.3	Meeting new people and creating relationships and being able to get myself into a line of work that I am interested in and learning a whole new industry.
0.1	The provision of training. Risk assessments Fire audits Provision of consultation services
0.25	• Having the opportunity to play a part in setting values for F5M • Development/implementation of intelliHR - in particular the work done on the metrics/analytics aspects of the platform • Developing IR strategies to support various restructures within F5M • Taking part in Fair Work Commission activity – particularly the Ashley matter when legal representation was denied and I had to represent F5M. 
0.7	All areas. I enjoy sharing knowledge and researching to find answers to questions.
0.45	Team work over state lines. It is great working with Jess and the trainers down in Victoria. My knowledge of how each state office works has broadened over the last 3 years whilst working with the NSW, VIC and WA trainers.  Communicating with such a large client base within multiple states. It is fascinating speaking to such a diverse range of people; from Wardens to Property Management. 
0.55	I enjoy the variety, not only being a trainer but in particular doing design work. I really enjoy drawing up evacuation diagrams. I also enjoy being made responsible for my day to day schedule and being out on the road. I dislike routine i.e. office work. 
0.5	I really enjoy assisting the  development of our team to reach good knowledge and technical skills.  Working closely with the National Technical Services Manager in gaining great technical knowledge and passing on this information to the consultants.  
0.55	I enjoy my role as a professional trainer, meeting other people and experiencing different workplaces.  I particularly enjoy design work and FSA's and audits
0.6	Have enjoyed the increased workload of the past 5 months. Taking over the DTFV portfolio has allowed me to grow as an employee and helped me understand other aspects of the business also. Always enjoy going to extra mile for the customer too.
0.9	The lot!  This is a challenging, demanding role that I have found, and continue to find, invigorating.
-0.05	Customer relations solving their problems.
0.25	Webconnect becoming stable and fast. 
0.3	Managing the team and developing them in to a positive and motivated group that work close together to achieve the ultimate goal of client satisfaction.
0.1	Drawing the floorplans / creating the signs. Getting to see the interiors and locations of different establishments, getting involved in large projects with my team.  The challenge of trying to get the signs right and for them to make sense to the viewers..... especially for properties with unusual interiors and layouts.  Have been involved in some interesting side projects a few years back.
0.75	To be honest I enjoy every aspect, I am passionate about delivering training, the personal rapport with Property Managers, Facility Managers, the participants.
0.1	As strange as it may seem I really like the data clean ups and maintenance– it’s just unfortunately there’s really not enough time to really do as much as we really need to in NSW. I do enjoy the geographical sorting, it’s probably more the organisation part of the role – I like organising things – but as said above not enough time to be able to complete this well.
0.25	I enjoy dealing with others and the interaction during sessions
0.55	I have enjoyed the diversity in the role and the opportunity to make improvements in the short time that I have been with First 5 Minutes. I have felt that I have been able to bring another dimension to the board in terms of business case presentations, improved KPI reporting and a quality board package.
0.95	I love everything about this job, But the design orders is what i enjoy the most. 
0.3	I enjoy client contact on the telephone.  We are dealing with many people every week, but because we are organising training at least 2-3 times per year, we get the chance to build relationships with these clients - and if we deliver good service, we have good relationships (usually). I am a people person, I like talking to people, I do not get intimidated by difficult or complaining clients, I can usually lift a grumpy client's mood. 
0.4	TBA - I think it is too early to say completely but I am enjoying it all so far.  Everyone has been very welcoming and lovely.  Should be great to move into the city.
0.5	I most enjoy the positive feedback I get from training session attendees and grateful responses from a clients when issues they were not aware of are pointed out to them including advice on how to rectify those issues.
0.3	Client liaison and relationship building.  I have found this to be very rewarding (although very strained recently with the issues we are experiencing with systems).  I have enjoyed the process in the ongoing development of the regions procedures and business disciplines and have worked well with Nick Grice in setting these up.  Mentoring the team along the way through change management and more recently with the cultural values we have rolled out.
0.15	To see the growth of my team from initial employment through to becoming confident and competent training consultants.  My own personal growth where I have very little formal direction or training since 2011,  so I have become responsible for my own personal development by having a keen enquiring mind, being resilient in the face of the many 'pulls' on my time and recognising that learning is a life-long undertaking. 
0.35	I have enjoyed the fact that I have learnt a great deal especially from the design side and consultant side which before joining First 5 was not my strong side as I was more comfortable with the training side of my role due to my background before First 5.  Secondly the personal knowledge I have gained in regards to AS and Regs and Building Classes which I did not know before hand I now use almost everyday in performing my role.
0.1	Empowering people.
0.5	I really enjoy working with my team and helping out anyway that I can.  Watching and helping them grow also assists with my growth.
0.4	I have enjoyed passing my knowledge on to the client to help them be well prepared to deal with an emergency at work. I also enjoy the flexibility that the roll brings.
0.7	I love interacting with our clients to provide solutions.   Selling and promoting our services   Seeing the company grow and seeing our staff grow with the company is what drives me
0.35	- I enjoy giving direct support to my manager and consultants (trainers)  that can make a difference on how F5M deliver to our clients.   
0.35	I have enjoyed all of it so far.   Especially going to Queensland and meeting the trainers and clients.  It has been a great and fun learning curve and understanding the difference with the legislation for Queensland. It has also been a little difficult with some clients as they are used to things being done a certain way by the previous person in this role. They were not always the best way and trying to explain that to the client can sometimes be a hard task. 
0.4	Although we have continually battled the resource shortage and sometimes unrealistic expectations I am proud of the fact that within 12 months of joining the VIC business unit grew more than any other state in 2013-14. Given the situation inherited in November 2012 this was an outstanding outcome and I enjoyed taking a group of people who operated in a 'silo' mind frame and were continually at each others throats (figuratively speaking) and turning them into a group that worked together to achieve the same outcomes. Unfortunately this did necessitate the removal of some members of the team for inappropriate behaviour but positive change almost always requires some hard decisions. I have enjoyed mentoring some team members to the extent that their self perception hand belief in their abilities has undergone a marked change that has resulted in greatly improved performance. I have also enjoyed the opportunity to influence the quality and content of some of our products despite the negative feedback sometimes received by peers who could not be bothered to put the same amount of energy into producing something better for consideration.  Finally I have enjoyed working in an industry that provides a service that is needed (even if many clients don't believe that) and that improves the potential for all employees of all our clients to go home at night not having been put at unnecessary risk by their employers.
0.5	Working on big projects and making them work, the satisfaction of seeing a folio running smoothly.  I also love getting to know clients and building rapport and relationships with them.  I enjoy initiating and rolling out projects from the beginning, making sure I have everyone on board to  make the project a success.  This is where I also try to iron out any issues that may occur internally for F5M to limit any to and fro when the contract is in place and up and running.
0.1	Receiving large job with tight deadline (achievable deadline). I think it pushes me to grow and also expose me to new techniques as I am always trying to figure out what the quickest way to complete them
-0.1	Ensuring that the department is running smoothly and assisting the designers and BU as much as I can when they require it.  Unfortunately with the work load I haven't been able to sit with each designer and see where they are at with work and assist in areas I feel they need help with.
0.55	Love the face to face training.
0.15	Being the first point of contact to try and assist clients where i can  Being able to assist with other tasks that aren't generally part of my role   Never having a day with nothing to do - always have plenty of tasks that can to be completed on a day to day basis
0.35	The Regional Manager role is very reactive and commands a drive to achieve financial targets,  a desire to develop staff, manage change and positively interacting with clients throughout QLD/PNG. Working closely  with clients to achieve their business goals and engaging with staff at F5M to achieve our goals has been very rewarding. The opportunity to manage Design and be an integral part of the rebuilding of the design team and processes has been excellent and this opportunity has provided me with another learning platform. Building the team in the Queensland business unit has been challenging over the past 3 1/2 years but also very rewarding. 
0.8	Things are going very well
0.2	Pretty good, yeah.
0.45	Things are going well, looking forward to some more training in Brisbane.
0.45	So stimulated and challenged
0.2	I am enjoying the role thus far, but have been extreemly busy in cleaning up historical issues. Hopefully this will be short term.
0.7	Very well, progressing nicely
0.35	Fairly well!  Tough to hit targets but still early days.
0.6	I enjoy my role and the organisation I represent.
-0.5	System inflexibility and speed at which business / offers can move through the system is a challenge and 3 months of unresolved IT issues.
-0.25	They’re going OK, I’ve had some frustrations with the way a few things have been handled recently but I’m putting it down to the fact that Chad has been stressed out. I know he's had a lot on his plate recently.
0.05	Quite good but I need to work on my time management more.
0.1	No probelms to date, over initial panic.
0.85	Good, feel very welcomed and am enjoying all parts of my role
0.75	I still have a lot to learn but the role feels like a good fit for me and I'm enjoying what I'm doing
0.35	Things are going well, but still there is room to improve in areas such as soft skills.
0.85	Very Well, Everything is gpoing great.
0.55	to my knowledge things are going well
-0.45	Busy
0.4	Great overall.  Working through each area to understand the mechanics of how it works but getting there.
0.15	Flowing along
0.4	Getting more confident with the processes each week
0.25	Good - will hopefully be able to improve once i have finished training design admin and I can fully focus on designing
0.5	Support has been good, and I am feeling comfortable in my role
0.05	Well so far - trying to get moral back up and get everyone working on task.  Seems to be ok.
0.9	Excellent
-0.15	Good when I'm doing my job and not that of others
0.55	Great as far as I am aware
0.35	Overall things are going well. Once the move is over, I think I'll get more opportunity to review and make recommendations for improvements and upgrades to IT systems.
0.7	Great, enjoying the role and learning a lot
0.6	Good :)
0.4	Good, still learning but I'm happy with my job
0.35	Things are going well.  Support is great.  Frustrations have been limited to IT and CMARS.
0.3	Well - just want to get completely up to speed in the technical aspects of the role
0.5	Great thanks.
0.85	Everything is going really well. I am really happy with my new role
0.85	Great. Great support, mentally stimulating, enjoyable atmosphere.
0.85	Exceptionally well.
0.4	Very good but still learning
0.05	They are going good but I can't do much until I do my training in the new year.
-0.15	The position has been demanding. I have successfully built solid relationships with our customers but have been working through several significant historic issues within some of the Key Accounts. It is difficult to balance the relationships when we are finding issues around our invoicing and contractual delivery. We are also being pulled into operational items such as end of month billing, sales performance, contract variations, etc. It is not all negative, I have also had some great wins for the business within the AEC, Uniting, Fairfax, MAPS and Opal accounts.
