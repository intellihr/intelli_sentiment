0	Worked with Kyle to Co-Present at the recent Good Guys training workshop.
0	Provided feedback to the Team at Harvey Norman Malaga who's Seasonal display (slat wall) had come away from its fixings and needed attention.
1	It was one of the best training courses I have done, I took a lot from it and Paul was fantastic.
1	The course was well presented, fun and interesting. The mix between presenting, discussing and doing was perfect. I really enjoyed it and I feel I learnt a lot and there wasn't anything presented that I had heard of before. Paul was a great trainer and I look forward to attending any of his courses again in the future.
1	Mary has applied herself amazingly to her role and has done everything asked of her. Her detail in her CRM activity is very good and prompt. She never shy's away from any task i have asked her to do.
0	Mary is currently undertaking specific commercial training.
0.6	Mary is sinking her teeth into a role where she has found little work has been done prior. She is trying to establish a good name for Fujitsu in the market place so is remaining positive about the brand and our offering.
0	Herman Brain, CVP, Using Diamond to structure Meeting & Negotiation

0.5	Andrew is positive in most situations. As his experience increases, he will be more confident with his work
0.8	Andrew fits well within the team and this is evident from positive comments  from his colleagues and customers
0	Some VRF training is due to commence in December
0.3	Not sure as yet it was all good.
0	I will always try to keep a safe work environment and with the amount of boxes we have to move of brochures, I will ensure they are always lifted correctly.
1	Excellent, I just finished customer service and key account management training with Paul Taylor and found it very useful for my day to day workings.
0.6	I always respect everyone's opinions and happy they are my colleagues and will always go out of my way to make sure everyone is respected.

1	Paul Taylor is one of the best for training, thoroughly enjoyed my training with him.
0	How to plan a proper meeting, handling objections
0.7	Kyle always has a positive can do attitude, nothing is a problem. One example is at short notice putting his hand up to support with initiatives such as the AIRAH show to support when there were issues with staff attendee numbers.
1	Kyle is a high performer with a strong, positive work ethic. He is an asset to the Product Department and the greater Fujitsu Business. He is held in high regard throughout the business.  With the training roll out advancing he is sure to make even more of a mark with the positive impact he will have on our staff, customers and perception of our brand.
0.7	Kyle operates in a safe manner in his day to day tasks. He has a safe work environment set up. I would like to see Kyle have more of an influence in this area by using the time with the FGAUST team and contractors via training initiatives to further enhance his influence in this area.
0.7	Kyle takes full ownership, the best example is how he has gone about the first few months in the training role. Once given some direction he has just taken the ball and ran with it.    Examples: -   Initial Wi-Fi / multi training for team  Working to find a solution of course creation for Airhub Refining the training presentation template
0.8	Within the Product Department Kyle is happy to work in to assist wherever required. He is happy to support all members of the team by sharing his knowledge.   He also works in with other teams to work in with their requirements i.e. organises training requirements around their availability. Also as mentioned previously is happy to step in and assist (AIRAH trade night)  where he helped the sales team when they had difficulties due to other commitments / available staff.
0.6	Kyle has had feedback from a number of staff on the training material that is being created and how it is presented.  Recent examples include the Good Guys training in WA and R32 training in Newcastle region with positive feedback received.   Training presentation template is also of a high standard.
-0.1	I'm sure there's more but the time was brief
0	Too hard to pick as this is the first time I've done this with Paul at Fujitsu
0	Structuring meetings and meeting content (from feedback of other BDM)
0.7	A respectable team member who is respected by all
0.5	AK to the most part very respectful. He can work harder to manage his written communications particularly to the BM's and the SM's.  AK is respectful in all of his interactions with other team members and his interactions across departments. I think he is a well respected member of the FGA Team.
0.7	AK takes responsibility for getting things done in his day to day role. He shows good ownership and ensures that tasks and projects are completed on time and with accuracy.   - sales forecasting - E10 processes and procedures and testing - Qlikview testing and development - updates regularly at WIP - manages EDI with key partners.
0	Homework, supporting documents, links to videos, books to read
0.1	Acting positively by not complaining and getting the job done.
0	Requesting information and assistance from my supervisor, when we need technical information we can not find.
1	Z remains positive and optimistic in any situation.   Z is the benchmark that others should be measured relative to this value.
1	Z will always take ownership of her own task and projects and will enagage where needed to make sure that others don't fail.   Z always thinks with the end in mind an takes initiative and ownership of things that may even fall outside of her role and makes sure that we can deliver.
0.5	I agree and support Z comments. Z treats people wit the utmost respect. It should be noted that this respect isnt seen to be reciprocal in certain circumstances and at certain times.
0.8	Z operates with safety in mind at all times.   Z is particularly strong in supporting the well being and mindfulness of the employees that work around her.
-0.5	Myself and Several other BDM’s have issues with mobile use of CRM, which I am told are being looked at and new Vodaphone network has limited coverage in my territory
0	Taking on other facets of the business development role including VRF product support for newly accepted Commercial accounts and assistance with service issues for example remote area warranty issues(Bamaga) and Airlie Beach service agents
0.1	Geoff is in the learning phase of his role and has just concluded his 3 month probation discussion.
0	Have applied for a coaching and 360 degree scholarship.
0.2	The entire session was based around learning how to navigate around intelliHR, so I would say all of it.
0	I have recently taken on extra tasks, training the Sales support Temp , processing sales orders & learning Fujitsu Assist. i am currently doing Fujistu assist job whilet Dion is on holiday .
0.2	Assisting customers warranty & service queries to the best of my ability knowledge & experience, thus reducing the calls to the Assist dept.
0	Currently working internally on ideas to help the communication between optimising and project management.
0.3	I try my best to always show a positive attitude even when we run into issues and I am frustrated.
0.7	I feel I go above and beyond in all the items mentioned above.
0.8	I'm highly motivated and have a good relationship with the people I work with.
0.7	Happy to try new procedures and work in on ways to improve how we currently do things.
-0.5	I am feeling a little uncertain with where I fit into the business given previous discussions, but no formal confirmation.
0.6	I have been able to produce some reports and data analysis requested by management to assist in making decisions about the business.  The budget process this year has been tighter and much better informed than previous year.
0.5	I'm going alright. Everyday is a new day and its always a new challenge set up for me. I enjoy it and I'm learning along the way. Switchboards and Comms unit at Hikvision
0.7	I have complete faith in myself to work unsupervised. I believe that the longer I I'm with Sheldon the more I understand the processes in place and can suggest ways to help improve them i.e. with processes for inventories, redesigning the O&M manuals etc.
0.5	Since the last review I feel that I have improved in my organisation skills and able to allocate my time more effectively to get work done. However I think I can still improve on this.
0.5	I do not have deadlines but I believe that I do my work in a timely fashion. However this could improve with some task i.e. O&M manuals
0.7	I'm very easy going and happy to go with the flow of things. I cope well with change and new situtations.
0.8	Going strong, managing to work on many projects and keeping clients very happy
0.9	Currently spending a lot of my time training up Jack and its rewarding to see him estimating jobs and enjoying what he is doing.   Non work related i got married and it was epic.
0	Group training session with Electrical (challenges and successes over the apst 12months) to be done with the entire team.
0.7	Shane has been influential in the past year, running large jobs, being a mentor to the team, investing time in assisting with procedural changes and implementing ideas.
0.4	Challenges are to develop external sales. Great job with Emma and our proposals of late.
0.7	committed to codesign and hopefully this is reflected
-0.5	is a problem as i like to do everything myself
-0.6	Needs to consider feelings of others when under pressure.
-0.3	Seems to be a little hit and miss on his time management, doesn't take much for things to change significantly.  Has done a good job on picking up a difficult project (Huawei) in Tony's absence, has strong support from Owen on site.
0.7	Settling well into role. Good cultural fit with the team.
-0.3	work surrounds good in warm weather but very cold in the winter
-0.1	not done anything outstanding at the moment
0.4	Excellent result on AJG despite some challenges. Managed well with increased workload. Needs to keep working on organising himself to stay on track.
0.7	Stepped up to Dmac being away and showing great mentoring leadership with JAck
0.6	Mick enjoys working with his peers and takes pride and value in the finished product the he produces.
0	Communication skills and knowing how to effectively get information across. We will be holding a team training day at the end of June.
0.3	All good, looking forward to another large project, doing alot of pitching/estimating to win work which is good but no projects currently on site.
-0.3	Probably still uncertain of her role.
-0.6	Needs more direction from management and for them to be very clear about what they want to see. She also need to think outside the box and needs training on how each department within the organisation operates.
0.1	Generally getting thru the weekly work but nothing notable happening outside of that.
0	Additional guidance on the office admin and P.A components of Heidi's role for these gaps to be filled.
0.7	always trying to improve. feel im in a good place
0.9	Feedback especially at MNF, cleanliness and care taken by Lome. really well done mate.
0.9	Works well with the team to get jobs completed. Lome is always eager to work and finish his tasks to the best of his ability and in a timely manner.
1	really positive team member Lome. keep it up!
0.4	with fairness, Lome was required to attend a family issue earlier this year and was required to take leave without pay. this is not the usual so it should be noted. however Lome has approached these situations with understanding.
0	Lome has completed his 6 Month probation and will be continuing as an employee of Sheldon
0	not as this point, keen learning skill from the team

-0.5	feel like we are 2 teams upstairs and downstairs
0.4	Im getting a grip on my new role of stock ordering and can't wait for the store room to be finished so i can get a grip on stock management.
0	Would probably like RB to advise what he thinks is the best solution for the above mentioned challenges and what Sheldons needs are in hope we come up with a solution to suit both parties.
0	- Launched IntelliHR software. - arranged suppliers to donate products to assist us in raising funds for the cancer councils Australias Biggest Morning Tea - Researched and retrieved thorough information and gave management in depth information on managing a legal matter (NM) which helped them come to a business decision without having to invest time on it themselves.
0	Not at this time beyond encouraging pushing the boundaries in selected projects
0	Have been letting viv run her own show ATM. Providing only very minor feedback. now
0	Have been following a much more 'agile' process for the A/B Testing sprints, though not fully including the rest of the team due to the nature of the sprint itself and the desired outcomes.  Kade appears to be happier than he was in the past month but doesn't seem to think anything much has improved. He seems to think 'responsibility', 'accountability' and 'blame' are all pretty much the same. Scott continues to be happy in his role and does appear to be improving and developing within it.
0.7	Not really. I'm quite happy with how things are going.
0.6	Having been off for most of the past month, not a huge amount. I've been pleased with how we've responded to the abuse on the US cluster and it's rewarding to see those changes paying off.
-0.2	Send more projects my way! Even if they aren't necessarily super design focused, if the marketing team has stuff they need to get done, I'd love to learn as many new things as possible while I'm here, whether that is sending email newsletters out, taking more initiative when it comes to landing pages, or writing content. Any little things you guys don't have time to do, I'd love to take on.
0.6	Created an environment of trust with my team partners.
-0.5	Nothing specific at this stage, though in relation to side projects, letting me know earlier in the piece may be better (no surprises).  May need to follow up regarding additional hand holding for kg/sg, and review as far as project expections go.
0.4	Attitude is good, happy with how things are progressing. Seems to be less friction within team lately (would like to confirm this observation).  Side project stuff looks very cool (as discussed previously - despite my surprise at seeing it first in a meeting). Would be good to look at how this might work in conjunction with advanced search and persistence. Would still like this to be more visible up front - per the "friday afternoon policy".  Good that AWS learning is improving - will backend this with additional dev changes around AWS usage in QA and eventually dev.
0.8	Michael is a good team player, he has been helping Raouf actively and they have been working well together. He and Trinh also worked extremely well.
0.2	Michael has been really trying to find ways push ahead in his role and I think his setbacks over time have been due to lack of support from his coaches and fostering his desire to move ahead.   I understand that this is a two-way street, however, in a support role where you are the main provider of customer support, it is extremely easy to get caught up in customer support tasks and not have any time in the day to focus on anything other than support.  I think Michael has also been dealing with some personal challenges in the last 12 months which have also affected his morale at work.  With that being said, I think he is turning things around and we are trying to support him as much as possible to motivate and grow him within our team.
0	Currently focusing on the SYS Task completion according to the goal set.
0.4	I'm moving forward with the beginning of the role.
0	Similar to the above, I don't think I have any comments.
-0.4	Include the whole company in what is going on.  A lot of the time, our team simply just doesn't know what is happening.
0.3	After Brynnin and Tegan left, I stepped up to be the fill in 'team leader'.  This involved being the go to person for Trinh and Janelle and also Henry to a lesser degree.  I took a proactive approach in writing support articles, templated responses, support processes and more in order to make the team work flow smoother and faster. I have taken on the responsibility of handling the difficult tasks for the team so the more junior members don't get stuck or stressed.  I actively help the team wherever I can and always help them when asked.
0	Slack went live.   Agency Templates Sharing got done on schedule. No re-designing, changes...etc happened after sprint is finished. Small requirement changes all happened during project work as a result of daily catchups.   New modern techs used in Account Management UI, and finally we have a SPA.
-0.3	Needs to have BA project in Jira Need to facilitate better awareness and acceptance of BA role and its importance e.g loose one weeks worth of conversions is = loosing $100,000 (CLV) Issues with using PC - wants Mac.  Need to look at budgeting Mac for BA Identified wanting to attend Lean Change Management Course - agreed it would be a good idea and possibly sending 4 people to the course (2 days) leanchange.org/workshop or Agile Change Management Masterclass
-0.7	Insufficient time to get everything done, possibly due to increased workload trying to prep for Bart starting. Would expect things would change afterwards, but it's difficult to balance the need for ongoing project/product management across the team with additional responsibilities.
-0.7	Expected a bit more from a few team members over the last month, particularly Andrew. Currently looking at understanding and addressing issues to ensure good outcomes particularly in relation to the AWS project.
-0.3	Some. Planning the move from DC3 to AWS is a concern to me in that I dont want to move a data centre model into AWS in a "drag & drop" scenario. Although it is quite feasible, it would be costly to run and not leveraging AWS to its potential. If it were just moving current AU infrastructure to the cloud, Rackspace would have been a better candidate.
0	The planning of moving to AWS.  Heading down to Sydney to retrieve the mail server before Xmas
0.5	Involvement in Deliverability project: Having to research and design a recursive DNS service was actually very satisfying. Also being part of the project team and delivering a key component was also a point of pride.   Another point would be mentoring Talal. There are times that stepping in to help him with a task is needed and other times when it is better to step back, and let him develop his own skill sets and abilities on his own. Which he does well.
0	Will be following up on options for getting him more involved with projects more frequently.
0.4	Meher has been going ok. He is very keen to be more involved in project work.
0	New goals identified during the meeting include: running internal design sessions (possibly small groups of people, depending on interest from broader team), and contributing to the town hall meetings.
-0.3	Will definitely be trying to work as closely with PK, and with bart coming on board i'm hopeful we can provide a better level of project support and guidance for him in the future. I'm still a little unsure as to what he'd like to be doing far into the future, however he does genuinely seem to enjoy his work at present.
-0.3	Generally seems to be enjoying what he's doing, though feeling overworked.
0	Too much stuff to learn. Lots of projects to do. Also get good answer for most of questions. Good friendly people. Good welfare.
0.5	Overall I think Adrian is doing a good job. He is continuing to put a lot of effort into improving himself and it shows in his work.
0.6	Ben is feeling good about what he's been doing since he started here. He likes and wants to be focusing on frontend which is aligned with the team focus.  He is happy with the current work load given to him.
0.7	Melina is really happy now that her PD is confirmed and her salary review completed. We reviewed the goals and re-proritised them according to BAU, internationalization of training and building up a certification program while evaluating an LMS.
0.9	Everything was great as usual.
0.8	Adrian's understanding of the system and programming in general is improving all the time. I am very proud of the progress he has been making; Especially in regard to the Admin UI project and his understanding of how it all fits together.
-0.4	Janelle is looking forward to having a colleague to work with in the US.  She is a smart person and no doubt she can be a good employee. However, I have some concerns around trust and I feel that I need to work with her soon for a week or two to evaluate her locally, the office situation and trust.
-0.5	I chose 'need help’ because I haven’t had to estimate on project tasks since the the review. I also haven’t had time at the end of friday’s due to the client reported bb’s that have been coming in.
-0.4	Not really, maybe just the amount of tickets that are queuing up.
0.1	CSRF prevention being switched on for our account with no issues.
0	I think we are on target to get the product ready for AWS by June. Otherwise nothing really of note.
-0.3	I'm filling out an IntelliHR form outside of HR week, otherwise it might be higher :P
0	Debt collection Reducing restricted accounts Bill run Receipting  Bank Reconciliation Petty cash reconciliation
-0.5	Chris needs a better understanding of the overall company goals/ vision, which will help him better align his way of thinking and approaching activities. This isn't a reflection on Chris as these goals and visions have never been funneled through to him.
0	Pain points - Instability in leadership. Chris has experienced a lot of change in leadership over the past year, which has not provided him with a clear path.   - Chris has expressed an issue with marketing projects stopping and starting due to a lack of strategy and planning. This is partly due to the above pain point.  Success - He has learned how to use GA to report on and monitor activities - He has improved on his social media skills in implementing and reporting on campaigns (although this needs work). - He has grown a lot as a team member in the past few months, taking initiative and ownership of activities without being asked.
0.6	Chris has been contributing well to the team from a resourcing perspective. There are no HR issues from a team culture perspective to report on with Chris.
0.6	Chris is very agile and has responded very well to the recent changes within the marketing team. He has used the changes as an opportunity to take ownership over a number of duties outside of his role description. He appears to have developed a mid-level motivation to further develop his skills in order to bridge the skill gaps within our team.
0	- Providing leadership and support to other team members - To ensure tickets, calls, live chats are handled quickly and properly - Creation of support documentation for new product features - Working with other teams to solve problems and improve the product. - Teaching new team members HTML / CSS
0	- Leadership / management (this is already being addressed) - API / PHP / JS - Organisational optimisation (something I'm interested in)
0.5	My role has changed significantly over the course of 12 months as my position has changed from Head of Product Distribution to Global Head of Agency.    There are many aspects that I enjoy in managing the agency channel as I look after the entire program and go to market. I also enjoy working with agencies overall. Previously I was more involved in leadership, coaching and being part of the company senior leadership in terms of helping to drive the company direction. I don't feel that I have the opportunities to work in these areas, which I really enjoy.
0.7	Have found the job to be interesting - the team have been great and very welcoming and happy to help
0	Project Development Bug Fixes Research Project Specifications Peer reviewing pull requests Thinking of ways to improve the product
-0.5	Challenge to focus as much as possible on the key issues with the distraction of some team members leaving and Lauren having to pick up some of the slack.  Looking to the future Lauren just needs to be very conscious of this challenge.  Does Lauren have a firm grasp on what is critically important right at the moment.
0	How is she managing Time Allocation
0	did my first successful GST rec unassisted
0	Nothing comes to mind at this point.
0	No additional training needs identified this month.
-0.6	Leanne's role is in the process of being changed, her heart isnt in her current role. Though she has continued to support the q4 values, her quality of work and meeting of deadlines has continued to be an issue.
0	Additional support will be required in her new role to ensure that she makes a success of it.
0.7	I am very grateful for this opportunity
0.4	The use of dictation to reduce time taken on file notes.  Continuing to adapt and change to endeavor to find ways to complete, train and delegate work to Rebecca and Preeti in a way that is effective, provides them with learning opportunities and will also improve the turnaround time for work - the adaption to written email instructions for RoA's and workflow has worked really well.
0	Main objective is to tidy Xero files
0	We are pleased to see that Amanda is more relaxed this year, and that she has reached out for some assistance. We need to remember to listen to Amanda's insights and be ready to help where we can.   Actions from this Check-In meeting (27.03.2017) are:  1. Scott and Alethea to ensure we provide some dedicated training opportunities for Amanda re Superfunds (suggested training from Caitlin on her return).  2. Scott to schedule a fortnightly training meeting (1hr) with AB, AR, LL and MG to enhance communication around 'q4 best practice' - e.g. Div7A / Tax Planning / Adjusting Journals   3. Alethea to work with all CMs (and Scott where required) to clarify what the approach will be to FPAs this time around, to ensure we have a streamlined approach (cf. prior year), and to allow CMs a better start to the FY.  4. Alethea will conduct some analysis (Scott to assist if needed) re existing FPAs and what our opportunities are, and how these can be handled in Practice Ignition this time around.   5. Scott to ensure there is a synergy here with opportunities to get 17x clients off q4s Xero payment plan (i.e. those NOT on FPAs).  6. Amanda to continue to raise concerns and work with AR and SB on identifying new opportunities to improve q4s 'processes'.  Scott and Alethea are committed to taking on all feedback and ensuring CMs are sufficiently informed about upcoming changes (eg Xero and MYOB), to reduce 'surprises' and anxiety around adapting to such changes.
-0.2	Reviewed the clients not yet on the cloud and reasons behind why, which ones would benefit from going onto the cloud. - Goal completed  Backoffis - review of capacity for July/August, working with Celine and Leanne to assist with Book-keeping training issues, feedback from other client managers. Goal - ongoing  Working with Leanne, ensuring weekly sessions are kept to and moving the sessions to another time in the week if have to be cancelled (rather than them just not happening). Trying to make Leanne more accountable for timeframes of work/reports. Goal - ongoing
-0.3	I would like some help preparing a checklist the I complete at the end of each job. I feel that i have been having the same "silly" review points come back each time which are normally based on things that i should be checking for. Ideally the checklist will help me complete a self review before i submit it review.
0.3	The main goal I am working towards is to improve my workflow and prove my worth to q4.  We now have a good structure and workflow in the bookkeeping team.  Celie and I have done a great job of brainstorming and working out what needs to be done, when, by who and how we can work best together.  Having this has improved my efficiencies for doing jobs and also understanding the clients we look after.  I am continually updating Buzz to ensure we have captured all the information so we have a reference to go back to.  With some further guidance and assistance I would like to improve my billing hours.
-0.3	I take a little time to work on some clients as i am still getting used to it.
0.6	I believe I am a team player and always friendly to people
0.3	Leanne continues to offer great assistance in getting proposal from thoughts to execution.  Need to continue to push this - some of us require more pushing than others.  LB has the maturity to work on how to position this and seeks appropriate direction when required. Happy with process of Estate Planning Champion.  This will continue to evolve over time.   What else - once LB nails this.  Tax Return exposure in new financial year. Financial Planning exposure in time.
0.4	Continuing to push me on additional tasks. Is dilligent in doing timesheet reporting.   Definite improvement on FPA process.  Understands the nuiances of the system now  Will flag need to assist with setup of existing FPAs so we are ready for an organised 2018!
0	GST reconciliations where there are a lot of transactions / payments going through the Integrated Client Account and also understanding rules around self-managed super funds.
0.6	I am working smoother, without having to ask questions and I am understanding my workflow
0.5	I am working towards Xero certification and doing Receipt bank courses in my own time. This training is helping.
0.5	I have a weekly training session with Amanda in which we cover current and upcoming training requirements.  I feel adequately supported.
0.6	ACTIONS:  1. Completion of tax returns - KH to coordinate with AR in June July  2. Build some clearer instructions for letters (e.g. ethical letters) - LB to create  3. Full flow-chart re potential client > new client etc. so we have a comprehensive list of actions   4. Learn the FP process from start to finish - longer term goal for LB, e.g. to either be personally engaged as an FP client or shadow MS  5. Area of focus could be Estate Planning (Champion) - work with KH or GT re next View Legal process  PLAN (12 months) - LB to consider what her 'purpose' looks like at q4, and how we measure 'success' in this role.   In general, Kelly has considered Leanne to have made a fantastic start in her new role, and as a firm we look forward to seeing her evolve as a professional and evolve the role also. Great work Leanne!
0	client engagement; identifying opportunities in a proactive manner
0.9	Celie is working hard going through all of the book-keeping files to get them fully reconciled. This has been an in depth process and has meant she has had to get a good understanding of a range of business clients. Her attitude in getting this job done has been exceptional even though i am sure she has felt overwhelmed at times.
0	On going support in terms of the client base she is working on. Allowing her to have the time to put the procedures into Buzz is a key area to.
-0.3	Sara after being micro managed to complete work within agreed budgets, decided to change career paths entirely.  She left here with that intention, but may have returned to the accounting professional subsequently.
0.5	I am happy within my role but I have realised that I don't want to be a CSO for another 1-2 years. I would like to be able to help the team more by learning the role of a paraplanner (not now of course but that is the next role I would like to take on). I believe it will be a big help to the team.
0.3	Processing has resulted in higher productivity; would like to think it will stay that way given the amount of things to be done pre leave
0	Captured missing information into one spreadsheet of what is prepared from a bookkeeping perspective for q4 clients
-0.3	Compliance work starting to come in but turn around time affected with Tax Statements on Individuals.
0	Continued to support team members
-0.3	Yes - it is difficult though to improve on each job as each of the CM's like the work to be completed in different ways.
0	I enjoyed the variety of jobs that I worked on.  I disliked the delays in getting jobs done.
0.5	As previously mentioned, I am looking forward to learning new skills and being given more responsibility. I know that at this stage, my work is more administration focused than accounting focused but if the client managers or directors believe I would benefit from any training that the accountants frequently attend I would be very interested.  I am committed to doing very well here at q4, and any new responsibility or challenges I can involve myself in the happier I am.
0	- Update of threads and tasks helping the FP team - Better turn around time for ROAs, quicker SOAs - Better management of the client review preparation process
0.5	We are pleased to see that Amanda is more relaxed this year, and that she has reached out for some assistance. We need to remember to listen to Amanda's insights and be ready to help where we can.   Actions from this Check-In meeting (26.05.2017) are:  1. (carry-over) Scott and Alethea to ensure we provide some dedicated training opportunities for Amanda re Superfunds (suggested training from Caitlin on her return).      - Scott to ensure this is scheduled in the new FY  2. (carry-over) Alethea to work with all CMs (and Scott where required) to clarify what the approach will be to FPAs this time around, to ensure we have a streamlined approach (cf. prior year), and to allow CMs a better start to the FY.       - This is now under way, and Leanne and Alethea will be sitting down with each CM to finalise the Practice ignition FPA drafts (end of June).   3. (carry-over) Alethea will conduct some analysis (Scott to assist if needed) re existing FPAs and what our opportunities are, and how these can be handled in Practice Ignition this time around.       - Will form part of the FPA discussion in June, a control sheet has been created listing all the current services, as a starting point.  4. AB raised the technical issue of opening MYOB files from Radix - Scott to look into this with Sentrian.  5. AB mentioned the difficultly in reaching current productivity targets without working overtime. AR and SB to work with AB on any process areas that may be able to alleviate some of the admin time. Also, we anticipate that with the introduction of more integrated MYOB workpapers, q4's overall productivity in 2017-18 will improve. It is important that AB sees this exercise as a way to gather data so that we can, as a business, look for areas of improvement, and not to focus too much on how it reflects on her performance. We understand that we have a long way to go to provide more streamlined processes.
0.5	As far as i am aware the quality of my work has been meeting expectations. There has been a steep learning curve in the ten months I have been here and the quality of my work has improved as my learning has continued.
0.5	I am finding the role rewarding and challenging.  The computer systems can be a bit of challenge, especially when I am trying to keep a healthy time sheet.

A opt in Mentoring Program for team members who with to gain some insight into how they can work on areas of self improvement, based on the experience of their peers and some great external resources 3. Building on the already strong team culture to ensure there is good cohesion amongst the all team members, and a strong sense of purpose within the firm.  4. A change in behaviour in the firm at large from their focus on 'completing jobs' to value adding. This will include a better use of non-billable time, for personal and professional growth, and an additional focus on how we all can contribute to client 'delightedness'.    Systems: 1. A firm-wide adoption of the new intranet site and clean up of the current docs in Radix that relate to HR and training 2. Better management of all the current software and web portals (e.g. LastPass) to free up time for the team 3. A seamless transition of File Plan from Radix   4. Some comprehensive training on all the current systems for all the team to empower them to use and rely more on these tools

0	Soft skills - conversations, asking the right questions etc
0	On a weekly basis I understand my productivity and billing targets. On a daily basis I am aware of my priorities.
-0.3	Job progress has been slow but I think there may have been a number of interruptions e.g. Xero project, assist Scott with IT etc.  Reiterate chargeable work comes first. Timesheeting has been much better the last week or two. What do we need to do in the next 4 months to help Hayley step up into CM role for smaller clients?

Clearer guidance and direction from management relating to how my team and my role can provide optimum value to the business (prioritization of tasks, progress of department performance in relation to organizational goals, opportunity to step up into other roles, take on greater responsibility and diversify experiences). An opportunity for secondment or experience in other areas of the business will greatly benefit my development and overall understanding of the organization.

0	Safety Zero injuries above First Aid level (3 x FAI) in 2017 YTD. Pro-active management of a couple of First Aid injuries with higher potential has prevented them developing into MTC/LTIs.   20 x Improvementgrams completed YTD – mostly safety improvements related to workshop 5S and other improvement work.  Picked up the statutory mechanical engineer role thru Q1/Q2.   Cost Opex - Under-budget (behind plan) for spend YTD – this is mostly related to some condition-based components that have not yet failed and were predicted to have failed in 2017. Work is progressing to review and spend some of this budget where it makes business sense and we have the resources in place to execute – eg B-crew planned labour just commenced.  Capital - $500k out of $900k spend completed YTD.   Productivity Trucks ahead of stretch availability target. Pro-active management of EH4500-2 structural and age-related issues is required in Q3/4 2017. Strategy includes full-time resources (now in place), OEM technical strategy input and implementation of rotable major components.  Backlog age has reduced by 14 days YTD. Schedule Compliance is running in the mid-90s. Planned work % is lagging – this is partly due to resourcing (labour supply) shortages YTD including wider industry labour squeeze. There are significant influences regarding how our labour pool is structured and the current site priority on safety compliance work rather than technical & maintenance management excellence.   People Completed recruitment of 2 x technicians, 1 x supervisor with 1 x pending technician. Culture change efforts are occurring – this is a long-term effort - but more work to go with engagement, improvement culture, trust. Recent EA discussions have been helpful to understand motivations. Recruitment will assist along with proposed leadership rotations in 2nd half if they get off the ground.
0.8	Nick has had a very good year in the face of some challenging situations that have caused his supervising style to be examined, with the result that he was found to set the example for other supervisors in many areas of the job. Nick goes to extra lengths to ensure that business opportunities are realised and has stepped into different roles during the year to suit business requirements. Nick is a thoughtful and experienced supervisor who has an opportunity to spread his influence to broader groups and forums. It has been a pleasure to work with Nick during 2016 and I am looking forward to 2017.

Kat is highly engaged with the challenges that her current role provides and his happy with the L & D opportiunites it provides. Kat and I will continue to discuss her ongoing development
-0.3	I have consolidated relationships with new Store Managers and key staff within the stores. I have a regular call cycle with all stores and training is done on a case by case scenario. Unfortunately this has not resulted in growth for this account with Good Guys SA down  5.15% on last year. This I believe is out of my control as the stores are not able to individually order and everything is done at Head Office Level. I believe the change over from Good Guys to JB HIFI is the main cause as JB HIFI are not allowing the stores to carry the stock levels the did a couple of years ago. Also having a six brand strategy is not helping as they have to many brands for the customer to choose from. I believe Fujitsu is still the number 1 go to brand for the staff unfortunately due to lack of stock and poor customer service they are losing some customers to Harvey Norman.
0	I am continuing to cleanse my state to ensure the utmost accuracy in order to be able to deliver the key findings required. I am working with the BDM's around 1v1 achievable call rates. I have moved accounts around between 4 BDM's to try and balance things out meaning better service levels for our customers and less weight on our BDM's. All of my BDM's have call targets and understand how many customers they have and what they need to do in terms of call ratio's after presenting these to them. We are geographically challenged in some areas and we aren't meeting our desired service levels in certain areas. I am on track to deliver this service level, but continual work is required
0.6	Adjustment in commercial pricing matrix is starting to pay dividends with some decent purchase orders coming in over the last few months.  At the half both commercial BDMs combined are up 25% in revenue YTD.  This is off a low base but its a start!
-0.4	It is becoming evident we only have the capacity to support a limited number of commercial clients.  Our advantage over Daikin is service.  When we over deliver we win our get additional chances to win.  Investigate potential of a 1 to 1 alignment project support to BDM or project support the also covers some SA work which will get Kady on the road.
0	For the most part on track with 1V1M. Will review frequencies further as customer intimacy builds
0	I always have the company PRESTO values in mind whenever attending any site
-0.5	Now that recruitment is settling down I will be able to spend more time in this area to ensure all staff are given the opportunity to complete any requested training with the confines of our budget. Unfortunately budget restrictions may prevent further training this year. This will leave a few people without the ability to complete Excel training which has become a demand of many team members.

0	As this project evolved beyond the initial definition, it is being split into separate goals. The scoping and feasibility review is complete. BCE was provided detailed feedback on the solution and approved a single college to trial it initially. CBA could not deliver Bank Account direct debits, but I suggested a fallback solution of using the E-DDR self-service portal for credit card payments only. Unity is keen to go ahead. This goal will be closed, and further goals added to pursue the Bank Account direct debit capability with CBA, and running the E-DDR credit trial for Unity College.

-0.3	Bruce Connelly and Luke Holz had a discussion with Rob regarding the work that he has been carrying out without direct reference to the supervisors. Rob Was advised that he must follow the work management process and that he is not to go organising woirk of his own accord. This was discussed in length with Rob who showed resistance to the process and after long explanation was told thats how the process would work. Rob aslo expressed that he did not want to be cleaning the workshop anymore and that hewanted to do other work. Rob was advised that he would have to do the duties that he was employed to do and that  would work with him to do other duties that he was suited too. Rob was not happy with this and advised that he would quit if he was asked to clean. I had to explain to him that he had toi do his role  and could not pick and chose what he wanted to do. Further to this we discussed the good work that he had also done and was a vlued member of the team

-0.2	I discussed the issue that was raised by Carlo of Freos cranes with Steve on 10/08/2017 at 15:50hrs in the production supervisors office. I asked Steve if all was OK with him as he seemed quiet the last 2 shifts and also that there had been an issue raised with the way he spoke to the Freos crane guys while a breakdown was being performed on Sunday night the 6th August. Steve said that there was no issues with him and that all was ok. I asked Steve what happened on the shift and he went on to tell me that he was frustrated at the fact that he had been told that the belt was right to go and that the permit could come off. The permit was taken off by Steve and then he came back to the belt to find that the counterweight was still in the raised position, meaning that the belt could have been started with the counterweight raised, potentially leading to another belt problem.  I asked Steve what happened then and what did he say to the Freos guys and he proceeded to tell me that all he said was that they would now have to walk up the ****** stairs to go and isolate the ****** belt individually.  I said to Steve that he just needs to be careful with what he says to people as if it is taken the wrong way by someone that things can go further than just a discussion about the incident. Steve agreed with this and acknowledged that he understood this to be the case.  I again asked Steve if there was any issues and stated that if he needs time off or needs to have a chat, that he just needs to call or let me know and we can organise. We dont want him coming to site in the wrong frame of mind and doing something that he regrets later and that we have no alternative for.  I spoke to Carlo from Freos earlier in the day to understand his side of events and he said that he was not majorly concerned about the language used as it was nightshift and everyone is tired etc, but he was just trying to clarify whether isolating it individually is the right thing to do. There was permits on the belt, then they were lifted and then the counterweight had to be lowered to allow the belt to run. Carlo said that Steve was fairly rude to the Freo crew when this discussion occurred, but he was not overly concerned. He asked for clarification on the isolation issue so that in the future he is fully aware that either way of isolation is ok.
-0.2	Observation in the last few weeks suggested that Bryson was distracted at work and spending excessive work hours on dealing with personal issues with excessive break.
0	Feedback session with Dave  Positives: * Knowledge of the plant and willingness to impart this knowledge to others when asked * Step up supervisor when needed, Dave has indicated that he does not want to do the step up up position full time but he is happy to assist when needed or asked. * Training of others in plant  Areas to work on * Spoke to Dave about the need for him to take the lead and get others on crew trained up in machine operations - Manitou/ Bobcat etc - so that all operators are skilled in this area. This will eliminate the need for the crew to be reliant on a few people to do cleanup/ lifting work. * Spoke to ave about the way we are planning to approach training for Kev in the plant. Asked Dave to let Kev be the first port of call for the plant and any issues that there are in there, unless we can see that they are going to cause major issues. Also when there are issues we should approach Kev not telling him where the issue is or where to look, but rather ask him questions around what he has done, what would he like us to do, has he looked at this area? Use issues in the plant as training opportunities for Kev.

0	• CCMP interaction held by Luke Holz and Craig Loose with Geoff Ferguson, Daniel Beer and Todd Lewis. • During the discussion the scissor lift 103 book was inspected and was found to have no inspection filled in for that shift. • When asked who had driven the scissor lift that shift both Geoff and Daniel said they had used it. • Daniel and Geoff had both used it earlier while replacing the rear struts and then Geoff had driven it around to the left side of the truck in front of the Hyd. tank ready to start the next job. • Daniel had stated that he had inspected the scissor lift at the start of the shift but had not filled in the 103 book. • Geoff reported that he had not checked the 103 book before operating it. • Discussion held with Geoff to reinforce the requirement to check the 103 book has been filled in before operating and if it has not he would need to complete a 103 inspection. • Discussion also held with Daniel and a Vendor non-compliance sent to his employer

-0.2	Steve Reddie raised concerns in regards to the IntelliHR training that is occurring.  This prompted Ken to raise his concerns along the same lines that the system has not been communicated correctly and that a catch up with some one is not training.  I explained that the trainer was on site for a number of catch up times where Ken and others can go along and learn how to use IntelliHR.  Can said that he would not be attending and that the company needs to provide formal training.  I again explained that the trainer was in place for one on one catch ups if people felt they needed it.  Ken continued in front of the team to say that he wouldn't be going and that he wont be suing the system.  I told Ken that we can discuss after the meeting, Ken continued to say that i can catch up with him, though he would not be going to the trainer.

0	Telehandler Lloyd was operating reversed into the stockpile spray along CV806. The contact of the machine with the spray resulted in a leak and equipment damage to the system.
-0.6	During a discussion with all the technicians about the use of Live Testing around Belt Press Filters, Pat was coming up with all the excuses about not doing live test permits. ( ways around not having to go inside the fenced area ). I suggested to all the group,  as previously spoken to them about it, the tailings tech  at the start of each shift fill one out with the required  JHA ( adding to it as required ) and your covered. Pat’s let himself down again
0.2	Greg had been assigned a service provider who had not completed the work that he had been assigned. The task involved gaining access to RC301 and applying rope lube to the harrow winch ropes. While this is an expectation for our employees, Greg took the time to walk the service provider through the task to be completed pointing out the relevant points prior to leaving him to complete the work.  This diary note was from my own observations and speaking with the service provider during a safety interaction.
0	Had a discussion with kev today in regards to his ongoing training in the plant at the CHPP. Asked Kev how he thought that he was progressing and he replied "slowly" to which i agreed. I discussed with Kev about this and that I was happy for him to be taking time as everyone learns at different speeds, as long as he is out and about and "owning' the plant. That when he is in the plant that it is his plant and if there are issues it is his to resolve. Other people will assist where needed but it is his to run and own and learn. I spoke tio Kev about different ways that I can help him out, with me not being an expert in this plant however, and suggested that at other sites I have set small tasks/ quizzes for the crews that i have been training up. i have done this to ensure that the people being trained are thinking about the operations of the plant and not just going around looking, but going around and thinking about the process flow. We spoke about this and the fact that it would make Kev go out and look/ learn/ follow the process and he is then required to come back to me with an answer to the issue. Kev agreed that this would be good and we agreed that i would put up an issue/ question on the whiteboard in the supervisors office each morning and he would be required to get me an answer back on the board by the end of the shift.

-0.3	This discussion was about Pat not fulfilling his role as a technician. The tailings section of the plant was the most challenging of the areas tonight due to the coal type been presented by the mine. Pat showed a lack of interest and commitment to keep the plant running to meet the required targets as this coal is to be loaded onto a train the next day. Pat took offence for being told to do his job.
0	Peter Sandell-Hay and Steve were talking to me about the number of machine components that are currently over due for replacement.  Peter said that there are currently 78 unactioned standard jobs that Steve needs to complete to get us back on track.  After Pete left i asked Steve he this occurred and he said that he was focusing too much on further budgeting work Leo had given him and not enough on his base load work.  I asked Steve to self reflect on it and what he thinks he can do better next time, Steve said that he just needs to priorities things better and ensure that he stays on top of his base load of work.  The number is also higher then usual due to the category of some components just changing from PM02's to PM01's which are what Steve completes.

0	Spoke with Dave in regards to the requirements for entering defects in Pulse. Told Dave that we need to put in the hours for any defects that are entered and we need to allocate labour to the hours for the defect. I told Dave that this was not a major thing but that we all just need to improve, also spoke about the fact that i had misled the crew and told them that it was ok to put the hours and labour required in the text of the defect. However, after discussions with Craig Bermingham it makes life quicker and easier for the planning department if we allocate labour and hours to the defect.

-0.4	Discussed Toms communication techniques and how he seemed aggrevated during the leadership alignment session on 04/07/17.  Tom was abrupt at some stages and shut down Leo Liang in an inappropraite fashion.
-0.2	Discussion was had with Bryson during the fortnightly meeting in regards to the hydraulic oil usage and cleanliness project. Clear instruction was given to Bryson in regards to the expect outcome of the project 2 weeks ago. However, according to the comments provided by Bryson in the meeting and the project database, it indicated that Bryson had not done the due deligence in regards to deliver the expect deliverable agreed 2 weeks ago, instead, only a brief investigation was carried out. The explaination from Bryson was that he had issues in acquiring the data for the project. However, I made it clear to him that my expectation was he should have let me know once he encountered the problem that requires my help to move forward but not wait until the fortnightly meeting and delay the project delivery. Bryson accepted this comment and agreed to meet my expectation.
-0.2	06/07/17 - Failed to complete project isolation permit during isolation process(centre pages not filled in). Investigation found lack of focus and disruptions during process caused permit not to be completed. Isolation had been carried out correctly so there was no danger or harm to technicians or machine. Geoff is usually very thorough when carrying out tasks so was out of character on this occasion. Geoff has completed the Project isolation re-assessment training package as was nearing the end of the 3 year appointment.
-0.3	It was observed that Bryson had spent excessive time (from 10:00 am to 11:30 am) on dealing with personal issue online. Clear expectation had been reinforced with him on the scene that he should not spend excessive time on personal issue during work hours. If the issue is urgent the business would be flexible and support him for taking time off to deal with it.
-0.4	Tyler has been failing to meet some of the deadlines that I have been setting via email communication.  I have also noticed that emails that I send him are often not read or are read far too late for them to be effective.

-0.1	Adam had previously replied via email to a Red Banner communications from Cam with a query regarding whether a situation in the workshop should also be the subject of a Red Banner communication. This was discussed between Cam, Scott, Adam and Nick and concluded that it was not an incident report or Red Banner. It is not clear whether this feedback was given to Adam.  On 25/7/17 at 2pm, Rod Hamson approached myself asking what was happening with the scissor lift exit issue detailed above, as Adam had contacted him to say that he still had concerns. Adam had sent an email at about 1:30pm continuing the conversation with Cam and asking for an update regarding the issue. I spoke with Rod, Tom Griffiths and Nick to get an update and then caught up with Adam in the workshop. Conversation summary:  - I gave Adam an update on the status of the concern he had raised and continued in his email to Cam today - We discussed the issue as being something that no-one at Bengalla was aware of and an opportunity to improve our systems with respect to the Australian Standards non-compliance - I informed Adam that it had been discussed at CEO/Mgr/Supt/Supv level that the event was not an incident report or a Red Banner. Adam said he didn't really understand why minor damage reports were entered but 'safety issues' were not. I replied that the issue had been assessed as a compliance risk and not an actual safety issue. - I asked Adam to raise issues like these with his appropriate chain of leadership first in future rather than going to the CEO. He replied that he was continuing the email chain previously. I responded that he would get a more effective answer by giving his direct supervisor, superintendent etc the opportunity to respond first before escalating if he wasn't happy with the response. - I informed Adam that he could come under scrutiny for his behaviours in future if he raised issues at a higher level before his immediate supervisors. He replied that he didn't care if he 'got a letter' for doing that if it meant he got a response. Adam seemed to loosely agree (nodded, 'yeah OK') that he should give his supervisors opportunity to respond before going higher in future. - I said that a stronger feedback loop could fix some of the issues if he felt like his concerns weren't getting assessed or actioned where required.  A number of other topics were covered in the conversation along the same lines.

0	Feedback session with Cliff  Positives: * Work ethic and sticking to a task * Knowledge in the plant and willingness to assist * Questioning of issues - Cliff is not afraid to bring up issues and hold me to account. Told Cliff this is good as it means he cares about the site and wants things to be right.  Areas to work on: * Wearing of safety glasses - one discussion with Cliff prior to this and spoke about the need to improve * Live test permits in the BPF area. We use them but we need to be better.  Feedback for me: * Cliff questioned if there was any issues with me asking Bengalla employees to do work as he said it seems I revert to asking Kaine McDonald a bit. I said that this was not intended if it came across this way and that i have no issues. Spoke a for a bit about this but this was the general conversation.

0	Spoke to Kev around his 3 monthly feedback session:  Positive: * Knowledge in raw and product coal areas * Electrical knowledge and breakdown repairs  Areas to work on: * Discussed the need to be the first person to the breakdown in the plant. If there are issues, then Kev is the first port of call and I have asked the other crew members to not jump in and fix the issues, that we need to let Kev get to it and try to rectify for his knowledge and learning in the plant. * Also spoke to kev about not walking past issues, if people are having problems in other areas (BPF's) get in there and give them a hand, that is how we all learn and this will help him tie in the BPF's to the plant and help with future training in this area.  Feedback for me:  * Discussed around the General Coal prep Course and we agreed that we will still send Kev to this.

-0.2	RH, LH and KF had a discussion to determine how long Anton was required by LL to completed the CHPP FMEA project as RH needed Anton as a resource so he could adequately start to plan for a CHPP shutdown.  LL said that he wouldn't need Anton after August.  RH and KF asked LL numerous times and in numerous ways as we wanted to make sure that LL was giving himself enough time to complete the project and LL said that Anton could go back to the CHPP on the 1st of September. It has now turned out that LL is saying that he requires Anton for two days a week from September to November.  RH has not allowed for this with his resourcing.  There has not been any significant delays to warrant this extra time. LL then said that it shouldn't effect Anton's work output for RH, i emphasised that we had already discussed that we would not require him at all in our team and gave RH the commitment.

0	Discussed positives and areas to work on  Positives: * Willingness to step up * Work ethic * Tenacity for not giving up on problems that arise in the plant. Ben sticks at a task to try to solve it and complete it  Areas to work on * Supervising - we discussed whether Ben wanted to do the role into the future and what is needed. Ben said that he wanted to but he was unsure of how it would be taken for him to be telling the crew what to do. I said to Ben that I dont tell the crew what to do unless it is needed. The crew run the operation, a supervisor is there to check and ensure it is being completed safely.  * Expectations of others - if Ben expects certain things of others he needs to make sure that they are aware of what his expectations of them are. He should try not to get frustrated with others for not doing what he expects if he has not made it clear to them what he expects. * Live test permits in the tailings area, we need to improve as a crew in this area.

0	Spoke to Steve about positive areas and areas to be worked on:  Positives * Knowledge of the plant, Steve is one of the people that gets called on when solutions cannot be identified * Training of others with regards to Kev and Kaine  Areas to work on: * Handovers. Spoke to Steve about just delivering the essential information that has occurred on our shift and that will be required for the oncoming crew. There is no need to go through areas hosed down etc as this is listed in the handover area books. Steve stated that he needs to give a full handover to do his job and that he thinks that is what he is doing. I reiterated the need to ensure it is effective and only the information that is essential. * Training with Kev. I raised with Steve that the way forward with Kev is to let him be the first person to an issues in the plant and when there are issues in the plant, we are there to be helpers for Kev and not the doers. We should ask Kev what he wants us to do and not do what we think is best as Kev will just stand back and let us do the work for him. Use these times as opportunities to teach him, ask him questions like "What do you want me to do", "Where do you think we should head", "Have you thought about looking at this" etc.
-0.3	qestioned Lloyds as to why he was sitting in a vehicle in the stores yard [backed up at the end of the row] at 5.15pm. he stated he was checking stock levels for stuart duff from schenck and he called him back to confirm. Lloyd was getting upset because i was questioning him and he said you are starting again [ refering to a conversation we had with Russell Hartin approx 5 weeks ago] he stated i could call Stuart duff and check. when i called stuart he said he called lloyd at approx 3 pm and asked about stock levels and lloyd had not called back that afternoon. i told lloyd that the conversation was over and that i would be making a diary note for reference.
-0.3	I told Tom that i had noticed he hadn't completed any Safety Interaction since July and i asked why?  Tom explained that he was very passionate about safety interaction, though he has now lost that passion as he is continually seeing procedural breaches in regards to PPE and sees that the technicians are not being pulled up about it.  He said that he is the only one that is having difficult conversation with these people.
-0.4	This morning, we had RC301 down for a maintenance day. Nathan had a job assigned to him yesterday 6/8/14 (on the plan) to source the workshop welder and make sure it’s here at the CHPP ready  for the RC301 maintenance day. On inspection this morning it was found to have no welding leads with it making it inoperable. I started calling Nathan on the radio but he wasn’t replying. It took about ½ hour to locate Nathan, which his explanation was that he was over at the Payroll office sorting out his pay and didn’t have a radio with him. I asked him why he hadn’t made sure that the welding machine was ready to go and his reply was that he just assumed when it was delivered to the CHPP it would be fine. The conversation got a bit heated when I said to him that is not good enough as he had 2 hours the previous day to make sure the welder was right to go. I said to him to go over to the workshop and source the welding leads asap as we needed to start the down day. He left the conversation swearing and saying that I shouldn’t be talking to him in that way. I had had words with him the previous day about not helping with a particular task after directing him to do so.  At the end of today, I had another conversation with Nathan about this morning’s chat and he apologised about his behaviour and said he had a few dramas going on in his life and that he should of made sure the welder was right to go.  He understood where I was coming from and said that he will do better in the future. 
-0.7	I had a discussion with Pat Morton around Safety and what I require from him going forward. After the recent discussions that Bengalla has had with regards to Leadership Intervention and Safety, I wasn’t happy with his attitude as to what is required.  Pat is a good technician, does the relevant paperwork that is needed and his tradesman skills are what is required to have the CHPP availability and production at a maximum. I believe Pat does do good work and is mostly conscientious, show’s initiative but sometimes doesn’t show the respect to his leader’s that he would like to be shown to himself.  Pat’s general mannerism can be off putting and sometimes very frustrating, he sometimes needs to think before he speaks. Pat let’s himself down sometimes by his lack of focus and commitment to the task.  I have made it clear to Pat that I won’t tolerate unsafe behaviour and that he needs to improve his mannerism.
-0.7	At the start of shift a technician who had just finished he’s shift had a flat battery in the carpark. I discussed this with he’s crew members who were going to attend this. Pat has said that he would do it but I suggested that the guys leaving can do this as the CHPP had lost power and I needed Pat to go to the plant and start resetting equipment. I went over to the plant to help out when I noticed Pat getting the Jump pack to go and help out the technician. I called Pat over and he displayed total disregard to what I required of him. I suggested to Pat that this is not the first time he has gone against the requirements of what is needed and this won’t be tolerated anymore.

0	Ben Bono met with Andrew to discuss commentary in Andrew's May Check In stating he did not feel respected. Clarified in face to face meeting that the wording of Andrew's commentary was not accurate and there is in fact no issue with him feeling directly disrespected. Andrew feels that there are other team members who do not respect other people and their roles. Made clear that CoDesign and Sheldon do not tolerate behaviors that lead to staff feeling disrespected and if that is ever the case it is to be brought to managements attention immediately.
0.5	From: Belinda Maybury  Sent: Friday, 19 May 2017 9:40 AM To: Roxane Kourakis Subject: Emma monthly check in  Hi Rox, I hope you have enjoyed the first taste of what the IntelliHR platform can offer and the valuable feedback it provides. Each month post receiving the completed check ins, I will be having a face to face with the Heads of Depts to have a review on the info the team members are feeding back to management and ensure we are actioning things as required.  With a small cosy dept of just one I am of course always available to discuss Emma’s reports with you however rather than taking up too much of your time thought perhaps will have our face to face on a as needed basis pending her responses. Her feedback this month is that she is really happy in her role (kudos to you as her manager – seeing our direct reports happy is what we all aim for and you as a manager have played a vital role in that!) As Emma has stated an interest in SEO training (as she mentioned this is not immediately required) this will come up on her reports which is great as will not allow to leave our radar and will be a topic can further discuss with her come performance review time so don’t feel you need to action this immediately. Best to probably acknowledge that you appreciate the feedback and is something we can pursue further in due course. If you have any questions, please feel free to come and chat anytime!  Thanks Rox  Belinda Maybury
0.3	No issue, Several colleagues across the business had praise for Brads performance at Bedford. Greg and Dan Walton in particular approached me directly to recognise the efforts put in on a challenging job. The Organic Response lighting control through out the set ceiling area was a new system we had never used before. Brad kept a cool head and was able to document the installation cabling and was maticulas in his understanding of the requirements of the system. There was also another large job in MNF happening at the same time and although resources were somewhat low, Brad kept a cool demeanor and got the job done. This job has shown that there has been significant change in Brads ability to deal with challenging situations.  there were also minimal defects to date for this job.
0.7	Have seen very few developers of his caliber over the years, would suggest this means he has high long term potential. Would be good to help facilitate his growth in this regard.
0	- security vulnerability was found in public facing software in production systems (nginx / proxy servers) - jira task was logged (good) - task was marked as low priority (inexplicably bad)
-0.3	Goal not met regarding systems being ready to deploy to AWS for further testing by the end of may. This goal has been pushed back from the original project plan once already.  Touches on both the AWS goal: "Security Done / Comprehensive - Network infrastructure deployed (bastions, gateways etc) " And also highlights that "Security First" goal has not progressed at all.  No reason why the work was not able to be done during May, no explaination of why there were no updates on tasks and no evidence of technical issues with tasks.
-0.2	No progress appears to be made on this goal. Issues still go un-logged, not comprehensively fixed, and no improvement on how tasks are handled.  Examples include rectifying DNS services on mail servers, where no task was logged and an insufficient amount of time being spent on the issue resulted in the recurrence of the problem.
-0.2	Friday 18th - claimed starting work on on-call + monitoring processes Tuesday 22nd - questioned andrew regarding spending time setting up the phone system for him to receive calls - claimed this was for ssl setup tasks - this work was not logged or approved, and i'm unsure as to what was changed. Thursday 24th catchup - after questioning work that had been completed in the last week, he had made no progress on the process documents, said he had looked at ssl certificates tasks which were yet to resolve. Claims that a lot of time was taken up with enquiries from developers, though on further questioning said that this was not a significant amount of time. This begs the question regarding what his time has been spent on since friday, as he has not followed the task management process.
-0.2	On the 20th went over outstanding tasks, estimates, work to be done for next fortnight, again reiterating the requirement that all tasks are estimated.  Only 2 tasks have been resolved in the last 8 calendar days.
-0.6	•        On the 03 June 2017, a contractor attended site during the day in the lead up to his rostered night shift. You were the Dispatch supervisor on this dayshift. You allowed the contractor to access the napping room during your shift. On return to the dispatch office a fatigue interaction did not occur and there was no notification made to the other leader of the event.  •        An initial investigation into the event was conducted on the 09 June 2017. A further meeting was conducted on the 19 July 2017. You were given the opportunity to have a support person present. During the investigation you disclosed;   •        You did not have the initial discussion with the contractor when you attended site and requested use of the facility. •        No fatigue discussion/assessment occurred with the contractor following the use of the napping facility. •        You did not consult the Fatigue Management Policy as you did not see it as “time at work”. •        You did not advise the OCE on shift as you had forgotten that the contractor was using the facility until they returned the key. •        You directed the step up supervisor to advise the oncoming OCE of the event. •        You were not aware until the next shift that the communication to the next crew did not occur. •        You understand the requirements around fatigue management and your responsibilities as a supervisor.   •        Karlie, in this instance you failed to communicate information correctly to the key stakeholders. Your negligence in this had high potential to cause serious harm.  In this instance Bengalla considers that you have failed to exercise your responsibilities as a Supervisor. At all times you must demonstrate the correct duty of care and exercise due diligence as a supervisor to ensure the safety of the technicians under your control while onsite.  •        In future, you must ensure that you communicate critical information to the relevant leaders. When providing direction to others you must ensure you follow up.    •        This discussion will be recorded as a record of verbal warning, further breaches of the terms and conditions of your employment; may result in further disciplinary action being taken.   •        The Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) is a free, confidential and voluntary counselling service provided as a resource to all Bengalla employees and their immediate family; the aim of which is to assist with the resolution of personal and work related problems which may affect work performance or quality of life.

-0.4	A discussion was held with Casey Baker by James McNamara in the presence of Trent Gallagher and Chad Pennington.  JMc discussed the following:  It was disappointing to have this conversation, but the circumstances had reached a point that we needed to initiate performance management for the following reasons:  Reason 1 - Failure to follow correct procedure when reporting in to be absent on any given day. This is despite the protocols being communicated to the team specifically around this topic. On discussing this matter, Casey explained that she needed time off to meet with her solicitor on a personal matter which she had finished by about 12.00pm.  Reason 2 - Casey is spending too much time on personal matters during work time as follows: 1) Taking numerous personal calls during the day in meeting rooms instead of doing work and not making up time. 2) Watching videos/music on her IPAD at her desk when she should be working with a total disregard for reasonable expectations of what is acceptable in the office environment.  JMc indicated that the business had been very reasonable up to this point, but the behaviours had reached a point that we must act. JMc also asked if she was committed to her job, as she seemed to be behaving in way that didn't indicate so. Casey said that she was committed and enjoyed the job, otherwise she would have left by now.  At the end of the conversation, JMc asked if everything he said was reasonable and Casey said yes.
0	Encourage Robyn to mentor the younger team members, such as Taylor and Tara, as she has a lot of experience. Emphasised that she didn't to wait until 4:30 to run FINISH. She confirmed that it was easier to do after everyone else had left for the day.
-0.5	Hi Supriya  Just a quick note to alert you to the fact that Robyn has again failed to action a system “problem” in a timely manner. Bruce sent me the below email on Friday 8th January 2016 to action these exceptions that Robyn was experiencing in BDS. When I started investigating the problem it came to my attention that this had been outstanding since 26 November 2015. Since that date we have actioned two end of month’s and an end of year.  This is the third occasion that I know of where this has occurred.  Potentially this situation could have caused a major problem. We were fortunate that it did not. Also this creates a unfriendly rapport with Melbourne, who continually stress that any system problems need to be dealt with immediately. At a recent User Group Conference a comment was made to the effect that Melbourne had to re-build a Fund’s accounts for a six month period because a “problem” was not dealt with in a timely manner.  I have stress to Robyn on a number of occasions that anything out of the norm needs to be reported and dealt with immediately. When I questioned Robyn as to why she had waited so long she responded that she had not been able to get a hold of Bruce. I find this extremely hard to believe.  Kind regards,  DEBRA BERRILL Product & Technology Implementation
-0.2	Following complaint of FINISH being run early at 4pm I spoke with Robyn and asked why. She maintains that she runs it from 4:10 but this is contrary to what was reported by Supriya and Debbie. I informed Robyn that FINISH should not be run before 4:15 to allow time for daily processing to be completed. This is also enough time for her complete running FINISH in time before her 4:30pm. I also said that if Supriya or I approve Robyn's request to leave early she should do the courtesy of letting her workmates know. Only asking Deb Berrill to run FINISH is not sufficient.
0	From: Fraser, Karen  Sent: Tuesday, 2 June 2015 4:37 PM To: Machani, Supriya Subject: FINISH  Hi Supriya, As discussed this afternoon, I wanted to give you some feedback re the running of finish this afternoon. We were not given any prior warning that finish needed to be run early and it was announced at 4pm that we had to log off the system. I was in the middle of closing 5 accounts for Holy Spirit Care and had a lot of direct debits that still needed to be processed. As the closed accounts came through on 01/06/15 ( I was given them this afternoon) I did not want to wait until tomorrow to process them. Apart from today, finish is being run at around 4.10pm which I think is too early as I usually have processing still to do. Thanks for your support. Kind regards Karen  KAREN FRASER Direct Debits
-0.3	Hi Bernard, As you are aware, Tara will be covering a fare bit of Deb’s role while she is on leave. With this in mind some of Tara’s tasks have been re-allocated to take the pressure off her. One of them is DD checking which usually takes about half hour each day. I decided to assign this to Robyn since it is fairly simple and not time consuming.  As per my email below, I had a meeting with Tara and Robyn. During the brief informal catch up Robyn had her back to Tara as Tara spoke, and did not engage in the conversation. I was taken aback by this behaviour. Just something I wanted to raise should there be any further issues. If Robyn had any concerns it was a perfect time to raise it. After all it was a friendly, informal catch up. But she didn’t say much.   Regards,  SUPRIYA MACHANI Accountant
0	Deb has suggested and implemented a new process to capture all completed DD forms electronically, reducing the need to refer back to paper files.
0.7	Email sent to Tara re feedback received from Debbie Rogers.  Hi Tara  I had Debbie’s one on one today and she mentioned that she has been impressed recently with your professionality when dealing with clients over the phone.   She noticed this in particular yesterday with the issues around ADF Online and not all accounts being visible. She said the way you dealt with all these enquiries was calm, informative and helpful.  Well done, it’s great to hear praise like this from other team members.
-0.2	An email (14/3/16) was received from our client, Lockheed Martin, advising that the Evacuation Diagrams delivered to site were incorrect.  There were two errors relating to Eye Wash and Shower locations that required amendments.  This will result in the entire design job to be redone (24 Evacuation Diagrams) and at no cost to the client.    Issue:  • The client has identified the issue • The diagrams are incorrect and require adjustment • The Consultant (Josephine Italiano) allowed these diagrams to be released to the client without identifying this issue • There is a 100% discount required for this to be actioned; therefore at a cost to the business • The client has been disappointed  Recommendations: • Mick Johnson and Gill Swindells with provide feedback to Josephine • The context of the discussion will relate to the above issues • Josephine will be advised that this note has been applied against her profile in IntelliHR • Further mentoring will be provided to Josephine to bring her up to standard with design work and this will be recorded on her profile as training.
-0.3	Hi Graeme,  Complaint regarding your conduct I note that I received a complaint from a client regarding comments that you were alleged to have made at the SYC sites at Mount Gambier, Torrensville and their Adelaide sites.  Specifically, it was reported to me that you said words to the effect “Is (name of client employee) in a good mood today?” and “I shouldn’t tell you this but …”  I met with you on 26 and 27 April 2017 to raise this matter with you and provide you with an opportunity to respond to the allegation.  I note: 1. You agreed that you did make the comment as alleged 2. You advised that you did not do so maliciously 3. I advised you that, moving forward, you must be mindful that it is unacceptable to make such comments when talking to clients as it is unprofessional and likely to offend a client 4. You advised that you agreed with the points outlined in point 3 above and that you would modify your conduct in future to conform with the level of professionalism that is required in your role  Graeme, the undertakings that you have provided have been accepted and relied upon.  However, you are to take this email as a warning that should you fail to deliver on your undertakings, it may lead to disciplinary action.      I note that you requested a break from training in SYC sites and that I advised that I would do my best to accommodate – but there are no guarantees as the operational requirements of the business must be met.    Email 12th 5th 2017
-0.1	I said to GH to be mindful of his inappropriate comments within the office as some members of staff had mentioned to me that they were not happy with comments for example I used to look after bees as"one got in my suit and stung my little willy".
-0.8	Received email dated 24.05.17  Hello   Sam comes in the office and firstly talks to me about Northline not having spill kits at their new site. Then Sam talks to Jamie saying he had Ingle Farm Shopping Centre and during the conversation Jamie said to Sam at 3:12pm, “so you were at Ingle Farm while I was at Netley this morning”………YEP!!  -  (Sam didn’t reply, just ignored him as did I.)   This was Implying to me that I do a bad job scheduling. This has made me feel really sad and upset. Especially since he spoke to me so rudely on the phone on Monday 22.5.17 and has been ignoring me since.   Jamie is making me feel very uncomfortable in the office.  I spoke out about his rudeness on the phone, not to get him into any trouble, but because I deserve to be spoken to with respect as we all do and now Jamie is making comments within the workplace that are upsetting me and making me feel very uncomfortable. There is no need for comments, remarks or negativity like this.   I would like this formally noted and documented in case it leads to further inappropriate behaviour towards me.  I handed this issue to BW to follow up on.
-0.2	GH came into my office tears in his eyes and raised the following points,  1. Was not happy that he was not doing the winery training anymore even though he is the Senior Training consultant 2. Felt that he was being pushed out by any new consultants ie Gary training at leigh Creek and Brian going on the next trip to MT Gambier. 3. Didn’t like Brian giving feedback on his training as he knows it all!! 4. This is not the way to treat people who suffer from anxiety attacks
-0.8	Email sent to Jamie 13th Feb  Jamie   On Friday afternoon I requested that you sent Siani a screen shot of your view of 250 Vic square from web connect, this you refused to do and also said that you were not raising anymore tickets to IT as you didn’t like the responses that they come back with.  This request from me was more than  reasonable as I was offering a solution to the problem and all you were doing was putting up roadblocks.  I found that your response was extremely disrespectful and a blatant disregard for my authority and what’s more was heard by other members of the team.  By the end of today Monday 13th I would like the screen shot that I requested you send to Siani on Friday and the ticket number sent to me as I am asking Nathan to investigate the issue and the response that Siani gave to you.  As to your attitude on Friday I am booking a meeting request to discuss this further with you next week when you return.   Kind Regards Nick

The tone of the email left me very concerned and I felt my response may result in serious consequences to my employment.  I didn’t sleep very well that night and on Saturday spent time writing my response….  I didn’t send it at this stage.  I was still very upset with the tenor of the email and spoke with my partner and others about the email.  They were all of the opinion that the email was very intimidating, boarding on threatening.  After their feedback I determined to arrange a meeting to find out the motive behind the email before I provide my response.  I hardly slept at all on Sunday night – and had prepared myself to be put on notice or forced to resign from my job.  This lead to my discussion with Metz on Monday afternoon.  Metz reassured me that there was nothing so serious going on, and that my job was not at risk, he simply likes to get both sided of the story in writing.

From: Corinne Hicks  Sent: Monday, 22 May 2017 8:06 PM To: Mark Pendlebury Cc: Gregory Metzger Subject: FW: Feedback from F5M training at Regis's Inala site  Hi Mark,  Please see my response below.  • Why you didn’t listen to the client.  My initial question was “do you silence the alarm during an incident to prevent residents from becoming upset?”  I thought I did listen to the client’s response and I re-enforced the message that the FIP was not to be touched/reset at any time.   I discussed what I believed was the most appropriate response to assist with communication within the facility and that is to use the OWS to alert others to the issue.  (Once you release the button on the microphone alarm will continue).  Her comment “and do not mute it to use the PA” I don’t remember this detail being discussed.  They currently use the P/A on the OWS for other announcements, eg: lifestyle. • Why you were disputing with the client at all I was asking about their current procedures to ensure I understood, but felt there was confusion around the difference between resetting the FIP and using the OWS.  I was trying qualify what was being said, this may have come across as disputing.   • Why you were disputing with the client in front of their staff The only time we had any discussion in front of staff was before the session had begun.  Staff were in the room getting settled, when the FM came to the door and began talking to me.  She said “I’ve confirmed….  we don’t turn off the alarm”.  I said something along the lines of “no problem, the P/A can still be used without turning off the alarm.” then she turned and left.   Comments below:      • The trainer also told the staff that the evacuation map was wrong in that the colour on the map doesn’t correspond with wing colours – this is clearly documented on the map and noted that they don’t reflect wing colours. At no stage did I say the evacuation map was wrong….   Beside the OWS is a template with the floor plan and a list with each zone identified with a different colour.  I was demonstrating to the RN’s that they need to read the Zone in which the alarm has activated on the Fire Panel then refer to the map/list on the wall stating where that zone was – I said for example if the alarm is Zone 6 (or whatever it was) which wing would that be in….. staff referred to the map and Zone 6, shaded blue.  After some deliberation as to where that was in the facility (orientation), they told we the incident would be in the gold wing.   I simply suggested and most agreed that it could help if the reference to the actual name of the wing(s) was noted beside each zone on the list.    • The trainer in this case needed to train to the Plan We do not have a plan for each site available to us, the EMM is produced by REGIS and not supplied for us to do any prep, this is why we needed to ask questions when we first arrive.  Perhaps Regis could provide their EMM to F5M for future reference, or we could create questions the Checklist to that provide relevant site information.  Can it be stored on Webconnect or CMARS?   Most high care aged care facilities would respond to an emergency in a similar manner.  Aged Care facilities are built so that an evacuation beyond stage 2 is most unlikely and advice as to which wing the emergency is in is critical for staff stationed throughout the facility.  This site does not have mimic panels at each station.     • Staff did not complete a full evacuation exercise due to overrunning with time The evacuation exercise was complete when the acting EC advised that all had been accounted for.  We then assembled and held the debrief.  Where one of the key items discussed was the need for continuous progress reports from the Area Warden to the EC using runners and phone.    ________________________________________   Corinne Hicks | Safety & Training Consultant VIC/TAS 10 Harvey Street, Richmond Victoria 3121 Tel +61 3 9041 2424 | Fax +61 3 9041 2119  Email  vic.training@first5minutes.com.au Web  www.first5minutes.com.au facebook.com/First5Minutes  hands on training      First 5 Minutes provides onsite hands on extinguisher training  using the latest environmentally friendly and safe training aids  across a range of commercial and industrial facilities.

From: Adrian Berryman [mailto:aberryman@regis.com.au]  Sent: Friday, 19 May 2017 7:41 AM To: Gregory Metzger Subject: Feedback from F5M training at Regis's Inala site  Hi Gregory  I have some feedback from one of our Vic sites regarding the recent training and drill exercise (as usual, never get positive feedback, only negative).  We had a couple of trainers to our Inala Village site – and they did different facilities. The Milpara trainer got glowing reports, but the trainer at Alawarra ran into a few problems. I have taken the following from an e-mail from the facility manager:  The trainer asked me initially if we used the PA during a fire alarm. I said no, but that I would check this. I checked again with Rhett Johnson who confirmed that in the village we do not adjust, use or switch off the alarm at all and do not mute it to use the PA –we confirmed this at our ECM meeting again today. On explaining this to her, the trainer continued to dispute this with me in front of the staff and had already instructed the staff to use the system, thereby giving them conflicting messages to what we teach the staff. The trainer also told the staff that the evacuation map was wrong in that the colour on the map doesn’t correspond with wing colours – this is clearly documented on the map and noted that they don’t reflect wing colours. Again, this lead to confusion with the staff about whether the published map was correct or not.   The overall feedback was that it was confusing at times and the staff did not complete a full evacuation exercise due to overrunning with time  I guess there are two issues here – firstly the Facility Manager did not attend the training – so she did not take the lead and hence the confusion – I have followed this up with her. The other issue is that the trainer came with the preconceived notion that all Regis sites always use the PA system for communication in an emergency, which at Inala is not the case due to the nature of the site. The trainer in this case needed to train to the Plan which appears to not have been the case                                                                                                                                                               Regards  Adrian Berryman National WHS Manager  t   (03) 8573 0617 | m 0402 896 876 e   aberryman@regis.com.au | w  www.regis.com.au  L2, 615 Dandenong Rd, Armadale VIC 3143

0	I attended Uniting Aged Care facility, Caroona Jarman, 65 Rous Rd, Goonellebah this afternoon to facilitate a EC and Staff fire and emergency training sessions and an evacuation exercise at that site.  Upon arrival I took up with the facility manager Kylie Connolly who immediately advised me that whilst she was aware that the training had been scheduled, she had forgotten about it and had not arranged for any staff to attend.  I offered to take her (as facility manager) and anyone else through the operation of the FIP (RN’s etc) to which she replied that she only had one RN and she could not afford to take her off the floor for training and she, Kylie herself, was familiar with the operation of the FIP.  As there are three separate facilities at this site, and I am scheduled to conduct training at the other two facilities tomorrow, I asked Kylie to contact her counterparts at those facilities to confirm if arrangements had been made for the training. She checkedd and confirmed that that was the case.  I invited Kylie to send her staff to those events but she reiterated that she had not prepared any staff to attend training and that her on duty staff would not be able to attend.  I then offered again to take her through the use and operation of the FIP. She agreed to this.  At the FIP I commenced explaining the various functions and she replied that all she did on arrival at the FIP was to turn the key (to the OWS system) to isolate to turn off the alarms and wait for the fire service to attend.  She went on to explain that she would then have one of her staff remain at the FIP (untrained staff) whilst she went to the affected part of the building to investigate.  I explained that this procedure was contrary to best practice and what I believe to be Unitings recommended practices and explained how the ECO should function in an emergency situation at that establishment.  With respect to evacuation exercises, Kylie advised me that they never activate the alarm system and only conduct a discussion about evacuating. I asked if she meant a desktop exercise and she said yes. I have since confirmed with Loretta that a desktop exercise is not a part of the contract with Uniting and that if we are scheduled to conduct an evac exercise it should be a full or partial compliant exercise including activating the alarm system.  Kylie stated that they cannot activate the alarm system without having the maintenance FIP provider attend and isolate the ASE. I explained what the OWS system was for and that it can be used for exercises without the system notifying the fire service. She replied that her instructions were to do it as she explained. I asked where she got that information/instruction from to which she replied that she had been here 11 years and had only ever done it that way.  As this is my first trip to NSW and to a Uniting site and to prevent me providing incorrect information, could you confirm for me that  -        We can indeed, as with any building in Qld, activate the alarm system using the OWS without threat of the fire service attending. -        The evacuation coordinator should indeed remain at the MECP and have her staff attend the affected area to investigate and report back to the EC as with every other site -        The EC should not de-activate, isolate or turn off the alarm system once the evacuation tone has commenced  Clarification of these issues would be appreciated before attending the other Uniting sites I am scheduled to attend this week.
-0.4	On 24th August 2017 Rob failed to attend the morning training session at the Royal Perth Golf Club.  We received an email from the client to advise that the consultant had not arrived for the training.  We called Rob to find out where he was, but there was no reply.  Later that morning, we managed to reach him and he said that he was heading into the office and would explain.  He met with me and advised me that his sister's child was very ill and rushed into hospital.  He went to the hospital to assist her and be with her during this time.  He said he was going to contact the client to let them know that he would be there later in the day to deliver the training.  I advised him that we do not do this in our business and explained the procedure around contacting clients and scheduling.  He was very apologetic about this and advised that he would not do this again and he now understood how things worked with scheduling and keeping appointments.
0.7	Check-In  Date  07/06/2017 Subject Person  Truong, Jane Client Services Consultant Victoria   On a scale of 1 to 10, please rate your satisfaction in your role:  4 Feedback  As we have had many new staff changes in the last 6 months i'm finding that people are not being properly trained and that's causing a knock on effect. To further this we have complacent staff and I feel like i have been doing my workload and those of other peoples/departments. I feel that if I don't then nothing would get done.  How are you progressing? Please give a brief update on your performance and contribution:  I'm happy with my sales figures for the most part and believe that i have contributed quite a bit in my time here. I feel confident in my knowledge about Australian Standard 3745-2010 and relevant legislation and having conversations with customers and stakeholders which a year ago i would have had no idea.  my knowledge of CMARs and its secrets grows everyday which makes my daily life easier.  I assist Gregory in the day to day running of the VIC office where i book, oversee and am the go for contractors and maintenance. If anything goes wrong I'm your person to fix it! Gregory obviously approves it!  Share your achievements What have you done recently that you are proud of:  From my first day here 16/03/16 to current I have closed over $1M in sales. I'm sitting at over $800K for this fiscal year and on top of the leader board. I'm proud of my continued sales achievements which was able to be achieved with the support of a wonderful team. These figures aren't just a representation of my sales ability but more importantly what we can achieve as a team.  How can we help you? Please advise any support required or areas you feel you would benefit from having more training in:  - Appropriately training staff - reception/admin/scheduling/sales. Everyone could benefit from additional training - roles and responsibilities, procedures etc.   - More on site time with consultants. This would better prepare us to propose with more accuracy as we will know what they look for while doing establishments.

When the scheduled were prepared last week, this session had not updated into confirmed status in CMARS automatically, despite being responded to by the client. However, at the same time I should have picked up on this myself; both via the event notes, and more important by the email below which comes through regardless of sync; all events which are auto-confirmed now trigger out these emails.  This session is overdue from May, but not yet non-compliant; we have until late July to run this session compliant as F5M allows a window of 2 months for evacuations. I’ve found a spot on July 18th which this can fit and have sent out an invite.  I’ve sent an apologetic email to the PM for this and promised to send out a new date shortly, which I’ve now done. The site in question was never notified for training by F5M and the PM is based offsite, so it could be none of the tenants were ever aware there was to be an evac today unless the PM had advised them.

-0.2	Webconnect identified that an EEE had been conducted, when in reality it had not.  Allegation and response below;  From: Mark Bates  Sent: Wednesday, 28 June 2017 12:27 PM To: Gregory Metzger Cc: Mark Pendlebury Subject: RE: Requesting written response - EEE Regis REGV18  Hi Gregory,  Please find my response to the questions asked.  1.        Did you understand that an evacuation exercise was scheduled for that time at that location? Yes, I did understand that there was an exercise scheduled for that time and location.  2.        Do you understand the requirements of the annual evacuation exercise as stipulated in  AS3745-2010? Yes I am aware of the requirements for an Annual Evacuation Exercise under AS3745  3.        Was an evacuation conducted? No, a Practical Evacuation Exercise was not conducted.  4.        If not, why not? There was initially a mix up in what was being delivered, as the Site thought there were 2 x 1.5 hour sessions not 1 x 3 hour session. So there was a bit of a catch up as we started late whilst Alan was trying to ‘round ‘ the people that were to attend the second session to come to the first, then people started leaving around the 4 - 4:15 time slot to go on shift (hence the Not Competent portion on the Attendance Register) so I quickly asked what would happen when the Alarms sounded and we verbally spoke about an evacuation of the Compartment and also a Stage 1, 2 and 3 Evacuation.  5.        If not, why was it reported that an evacuation was conducted? It  was reported that an Evacuation Exercise was conducted as a Desktop Exercise.  6.        If no evacuation was conducted, how did it result that in the report it is reported that the evacuation commenced at 4.30p.m and concluded at 4.36p.m It  was around the time that I discussed what would you do in an Evacuation (especially a Stage 1 and stage 2 evacuation) and how long would it take to evacuate the Compartment, I can’t recall how many residents were to a Compartment, but in the discussion it was around the 5 -6 minute mark. Hence the timing.  7.        You closed the report with “I certify that this training report is true and correct”.  Is the report true and correct? I believe that “I certify that this training report is true and correct” is automatically generated after you do the report on Webconnect, I would have to do a Evac report to see if that you do acknowledge that it is ‘true and correct’. Is the report true and correct, I believe so, as it was as a Desktop exercise.  8.        Have you failed to deliver evacuation exercises at other sites?  There may have been a couple of Sites where an Exercise hasn’t been conducted, but that would have been through the decision of the Site, as they have requested not to sound the Alarms or can it be done as a talk (as it has been done that way before), when it does come to that point I do tell them that they are down for an Evacuation Exercise, sometimes they just say there isn’t a place to conduct the Exercise or nothing has been organised.   9.        If so, which ones, when and why? I honestly cannot remember which sites, but they Evacuation Report should have the ‘Compliant’ section ticked as Desktop Exercise.  I also did notice that it hadn’t been ticked or displayed as a Desktop Exercise on the attached report you sent, and I did check it in Webconnect and yes. It wasn’t checked as a Desktop Exercise, I know I did tick it though.   If there is anything else required, please let me know and I will do my best to help, not only F5M, but Regis as well.

I must warn you that this may have a disciplinary outcome.  I need a written response by Monday 0900 hours, 3rd July 2017.

-0.4	From: Mark Pendlebury  Sent: Friday, 7 July 2017 12:08 PM To: Gregory Metzger Subject: RE: Emergency Diagram review  Metz,  In the past, Consultants have been well drilled on NOT changing appointed attendance times, particularly C&W sites.  Consultants are to ring the office and speak with Jess or Stephen and ask them to make the request from the client for an earlier arrival.   This all came to a head some time ago due to Colin Martin doing a similar thing which caused a bit of a ruckus…..but that was for training, this issue is for an establishment.  I note that the complainant said that they’d moved bookings etc, but for an establishment?   There should have been no change to their daily routine, but maybe they misunderstood the type of work we were attending the site for.  Anyway, I can see Nerida’s logic, get in there early to clear time to complete the design work. Irrespective of her intentions and the temperature, she knows full well to ring the office with this type of request.  I’ve spoken with Nerida, and despite her inclination to go home I’ve advised her to come into the office and get the work done and uploaded (as I figured you may well like to speak with her).
